## v9.8.1 GTO Maintenance Sync (20 May 2026)

**Retrieval Hardening, Context Compaction & Ghost Reference Cleanup**

### Key Changes

#### Retrieval Architecture
- **Cross-Encoder Reranking Enabled**: `/ultrastart` Phase 4 now passes `--rerank` to `smart_search.py`. The reranker model (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2`) was already loaded and functional — this flag was simply never being passed. With 15 candidates, reranking provides meaningful precision improvement. `/start` (3 candidates) remains un-reranked by design.
- **TAG_INDEX Retirement**: All references to `TAG_INDEX.md` replaced with `PROTOCOL_SUMMARIES.md` across workflows and documentation. TAG_INDEX was the v1 discovery mechanism; PROTOCOL_SUMMARIES provides richer per-protocol summaries with frontmatter extraction.
- **PROTOCOL_HEATMAP**: Usage-frequency index now referenced in retrieval stack alongside PROTOCOL_SUMMARIES.

#### Context Management
- **activeContext Compaction**: Compressed from 184 → 40 lines. Moved S317–S374 to `sessionArchive.md`. Constraint rule changed from "80-line cap" to "15K token / ~60KB budget" — line count is the wrong unit; boot-load token cost is what matters.
- **Session Log Source Clarification**: `/ultraend` Phase 1 Step 1 now explicitly specifies reading from `.context/memories/session_logs/` (full session log files) rather than compacted archive entries in `activeContext.md`.

#### Infrastructure
- **Retrieval Telemetry**: Wired `retrieval_log.jsonl` instrumentation into `search.py`. Every search invocation now logs query, limit, result quality classification (hit/partial/miss), confidence distribution, and source channel distribution.
- **Protocol Summary Generator Fix**: `generate_protocol_summaries.py` fallback logic fixed to extract substantive body paragraphs instead of echoing the protocol title.

## Documentation Sync (16 May 2026)

**Systems Thinking Concept Doc + Reference & Link Hardening**

### Key Changes

#### New Concept Page
- **Systems Thinking** (NEW): `docs/concepts/Systems_Thinking.md` — Formalizes Athena's default problem-solving methodology. Documents the 7-step implicit systems thinking pipeline (Event Scan → Pattern Match → Structural Audit → Feedback Mapping → Leverage Search → Cross-Domain Test → Ergodicity Gate), the Iceberg Model as the default analytical depth, feedback loop recognition, leverage point identification, and the "Structure Drives Behavior" principle. Cross-references the 14 Meta-Patterns as the "Unified Field Theory" engine. Concept count: 8 → **9**.

#### Reference & Link Hardening
- **Meadows (2008)** and **Senge (1990)** added to REFERENCES.md under "Systems Biology & Cognitive Architecture" — foundational systems thinking citations referenced in the new concept doc.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md See Also** updated: Systems Thinking concept link added for cross-navigation.
- **KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md**: Concept count 8 → 9, Systems Thinking row added to concept table, mermaid diagram count updated.
- **GLOSSARY.md**: Systems Thinking entry added to Core Concepts section (from prior session).

## v9.8.8 (12 May 2026)

**Model Version Sync — Provenance Standard & Frontier Model Alignment**

### Key Changes

#### Model Version Updates
- **Claude Opus 4.6 → 4.7** (released April 16, 2026) across all public surfaces
- **GPT-5.4 → 5.5** (released April 23, 2026) across all public surfaces
- Both versions web-verified against official release announcements

#### Provenance Standard (Reddit Deep-Dive Audit)
- **CANONICAL.md Provenance Tagging**: New mandatory format for all canonical entries: `(Session S[NNN], [YYYY-MM-DD])`. Every assertion traceable to its origin session. Prevents memory drift.
- **`/end` Workflow Gate Hardening**: Canonical Check (Phase 1B, Step 3) now blocks new entries without valid provenance tags. Mechanical enforcement, not aspirational.

## v9.8.7 (11 May 2026)

**Hermes Agent Steal — Automated Skill Compiler**

### New Skills
- **`skill-compiler`** (NEW): `examples/skills/workflow/skill-compiler/SKILL.md` — Automated solved-to-skill compiler. When Athena solves a novel, complex task (≥5 turns, ≥3 tools, confirmed success), this skill auto-drafts a new SKILL.md from the solution trajectory. Problem classes get solved once, then never re-derived. Stolen from NousResearch/hermes-agent's learning loop architecture.

### Stolen Patterns (Hermes Intelligence)
- **Curator Lifecycle Model** (absorbed into skill-compiler): 3-state lifecycle (`active` → `stale` → `archived`) with automatic transitions based on invocation recency. Pin exemption (`pinned: true` frontmatter bypasses all auto-transitions). Never-delete invariant (maximum destructive action is archive). Source: `agent/curator.py` (800+ lines).
- **Umbrella Consolidation Rule**: "A collection of hundreds of narrow skills where each one captures one session's specific bug is a FAILURE of the library." Narrow, session-specific fixes are absorbed into broad, class-level skills rather than proliferating micro-entries.

### What Was NOT Stolen (and Why)
- **DSPy + GEPA Self-Evolution**: Requires Python infrastructure + API costs (~$2-10/run). Deferred — not zero-overhead.
- **SQLite Skill Telemetry**: Athena's git-tracked `.agent/skills/` provides `git log` + `git blame` — superior audit trail.
- **Background Curator Cron**: Athena already has `/audit` + `/needful`. Adding a daemon would duplicate.

### Files Changed

- `examples/skills/workflow/skill-compiler/SKILL.md` — NEW
- `AGENTS.md` — Skill table updated, version bump (v9.8.6→v9.8.7), Hermes steal in pattern source
- `README.md` — Version badge (v9.8.6→v9.8.7), SDK version, changelog entry
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Version, skills count (28→29), version history entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.8.5→9.8.7)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

## v9.8.6 (11 May 2026)

**Infrastructure Hardening — GateGuard + De-Sloppify Protocols**

### New Protocols
- **ENG-542 — GateGuard (Read-Before-Write Enforcement)**: Mandates deterministic investigation before any file modification. Agents must read the target file, grep for related patterns, and verify current state before proposing changes. Prevents blind edits, stale assumptions, and hallucinated file contents.
- **QUA-541 — De-Sloppify Pass (Two-Pass Implementation)**: Separates implementation from cleanup into two distinct passes. Pass 1 focuses on correctness and feature delivery. Pass 2 (mandatory) sweeps for leftover debug code, placeholder text, inconsistent naming, and missing edge cases. Prevents quality drift under creative flow.

### Structural Changes
- **`quality/` Category Re-introduced**: New category for quality-assurance protocols. Previously purged in v9.8.3 (contained redundant protocols); now re-populated with purpose-built QUA-series protocols.
- **Protocol Categories**: 15 → **16** (architecture, coding, content, decision, engineering, memory, meta, pattern-detection, quality, reasoning, research, safety, strategy, trading, verification, workflow)
- **Anti-Patterns**: 3 new entries added to `_shared.md` — De-Sloppify corollary, GateGuard corollary, Config Protection corollary

### Date & Version Sync
- All public surfaces (README, AGENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE, CHANGELOG, GLOSSARY, KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH, REFERENCES, SPEC_SHEET) synced to 11 May 2026
- KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH and SPEC_SHEET version bumped to v9.8.6

### Files Changed

- `examples/protocols/engineering/ENG-542-gateguard-read-before-write.md` — NEW
- `examples/protocols/quality/QUA-541-de-sloppify-pass.md` — NEW
- `examples/workflows/_shared.md` — 3 new anti-patterns
- `README.md` — Date, category count (15→16)
- `AGENTS.md` — Date, category count, category names surfaced
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Date sync
- `docs/GLOSSARY.md` — Date sync

## v9.8.5 (08 May 2026)

**MinMax Token Economy**

### Operational Doctrine
- **Token Economy Mode**: Replaced Maximum Depth + Pre-Paid Compute doctrines with MinMax Token Economy + JIT Compute doctrines. System now optimises for quality/token ratio under quota-limited AI subscriptions.
- **`/minmax` Workflow**: Flagship workflow for quota-constrained users — maintains the same quality floor while reducing token consumption by ~74% through structured compression and attention-budget guards.

### Metrics & Sync
- **Session Count**: 1,750+ → 1,800+ (filesystem-verified)
- **Date Alignment**: All public surfaces (README, ARCHITECTURE, SPEC_SHEET, CHANGELOG, GLOSSARY, ABOUT_ME, AGENTS.md, pyproject.toml) synced to 8 May 2026
- **Wiki Refresh**: All 7 wiki pages updated from v9.6.6 → v9.8.5 (Home, Getting-Started, FAQ, Workflow-Reference, Use-Cases, Philosophy, The-Compounding-Effect)
- **SDK Version**: pyproject.toml bumped to 9.8.5

### Documentation
- **README**: Added MinMax doctrine callout in pricing section for quota-limited plans
- **AGENTS.md**: Version and date synced to v9.8.5 / 2026-05-08
- **GLOSSARY**: Session count updated, date synced

---

## v9.8.4 (01 May 2026)

**GTO Metrics Sync — Meta-Pattern Framework v2.0**

### Key Changes

#### Meta-Pattern Framework v2.0 (7→14 Universal Laws)
- **7 new internal meta-patterns added** (MP-8 through MP-14): Expanding the framework from 7 external/structural patterns to 14 universal laws covering both external (market/arena) and internal (psychological/decision) domains.
  - **MP-8 (Wound-Selects-For-Itself)**: Unexamined psychological schemas create recursive selection loops that re-select for injury.
  - **MP-9 (Leverage Inversion)**: The GTO play is repositioning the fulcrum, not grinding harder at the lever.
  - **MP-10 (Information-Action Gap)**: Structural barriers (utility, filtration, commitment) prevent rational action despite available information.
  - **MP-11 (Iteration Economy)**: The winner is defined by iterations-per-unit-cost, not raw effort.
  - **MP-12 (Articulation Penalty)**: Structural truth and social distribution are inversely correlated.
  - **MP-13 (Principal-Agent Misalignment)**: Delegation drifts toward agent incentives unless mechanically constrained.
  - **MP-14 (Sunk Cost Gravity Well)**: Ego-driven entrapment in legacy positions.
- **Unified Axiom** expanded: *"Own the arena. Own the asset. Own the structure. Own the narrative. Own the exit. Everything else is rent — including the stories you tell yourself."*
- **Interaction matrix** expanded from 7×7 to 14×14 with cross-domain (external↔internal) interaction examples.

#### Filesystem-Verified Metrics Sync
- **Protocols**: 378 → **382** active (filesystem-verified: `find .agent/skills/protocols -name '*.md'`)
- **Case Studies**: 433 → **443** (filesystem-verified: `ls .context/memories/case_studies/*.md`)
- **Workflows**: 68 → **73** (filesystem-verified: `find .agent/workflows -name '*.md'`)
- **Sessions**: 1,700+ → **1,750+** (375 session log files)
- **Scripts**: 240+ → **220+** (pruned: `find .agent/scripts -name '*.py'`)

### Design Decisions

- The 14-pattern framework divides cleanly into **External Structures** (MP-1→7: Arenas, Markets, Assets) and **Internal Structures** (MP-8→14: Psychology, Epistemology, Decision Architecture). Future audits now require a two-pass check: external pass + internal pass.
- Script count *decreased* from 240+ to 220+ — reflects accurate filesystem count after pruning passes. Not a regression.
- Meta-pattern expansion originated from a cross-workspace synthesis of 443 case studies and 382 protocols, identifying recurring internal/cognitive patterns that were previously implicit.

### Files Changed

- `README.md` — Version badge (v9.8.3→v9.8.4), date, protocol count (150+→155+), workflow count (70+→73+), SDK version, changelog entry
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Version, date, all metric counts (protocols, case studies, workflows, scripts, sessions), mermaid diagrams, compositional hierarchy, orchestration layer, version history entry
- `docs/GLOSSARY.md` — Date, protocol count (378→382), key metrics table (sessions, protocols, scripts)
- `docs/SPEC_SHEET.md` — Version (v9.8.3→v9.8.4), date, session count (1,662+→1,750+)
- `docs/ABOUT_ME.md` — Session count (×3: 1,700+→1,750+), case study count (440+→443+), scripts count (240+→220+)
- `AGENTS.md` — Version (v9.8.3→v9.8.4), date, protocol count (150→155)
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.8.3→9.8.4)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

## v9.8.3 (19 April 2026)

**Synaptic Pruning — Neural Network Consolidation Pass**

### Key Changes

#### Protocol Deduplication Audit
- **17 duplicate protocols archived**: 3 exact duplicates (DIA-002, DIA-003, ENG-43), 11 concept duplicates (absorbed into superior versions), 3 red-team versioning artifacts. All moved to `.agent/skills/protocols/archive/` with successor references.
- **`quality/` category purged**: All contents redundant with existing protocols. Category eliminated.
- **Active protocols**: 395 → **378** | Archived: 15 → **32** | Total: 410 (unchanged)
- **Categories**: 35 → **34**

#### Case Study Deduplication Audit
- **7 duplicate case studies merged and archived**: Content from each deprecated file was merged into the surviving canonical version (no data loss). Archived to `.context/memories/case_studies/_archived/`.
  - CS-527 ← CS-528 (Athena Feb 11 launch: final numbers + 12hr snapshot merged)
  - CS-525 ← CS-524 (FX data analysis: refined + full CSV stats merged)
  - CS-236 ← CS-190 (Reddit Jan 3 launch: authenticity premium + early metrics merged)
  - CS-508 ← CS-484 (OpenClaw: architecture analysis + sandbox steal merged)
  - CS-425 ← CS-374 (Academic essay: workflow + theory force-fitting pattern merged)
  - CS-543 ← CS-447 (Vibe SaaS: $10K MRR + early 1500 users data point merged)
  - CST-33 kept, CS-497 archived (Chia Boon Teck: protocol version richer at 105 vs 52 lines)
- **Active case studies**: 440 → **433** | Archived: **7**

#### ARCHITECTURE.md Metrics Reconciliation
- All counts across README.md, AGENTS.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, pyproject.toml synchronized to filesystem-verified values.
- Biological analogy (Compositional Hierarchy) updated: Cells layer now reads "378 Protocols (32 archived)".

### Design Decisions

- **Neural Network Model**: The consolidation follows the principle that every node (protocol, case study, skill) must be unique — no redundant neurons. Overlapping content is merged into the surviving version as an appendix, creating new cross-references (synaptic connections) that didn't exist before. This is "synaptic pruning" — trimming redundant connections so the remaining network fires cleaner.
- **No Re-Organization Policy**: Case studies remain in their flat directory structure. Moving files would break vector store, GraphRAG, and Supabase routing references. The `_archived/` subdirectory is the only structural change.
- **Protocol Cap**: Set to 500 in CAPS.json to accommodate future growth without immediate pressure.

### Files Changed

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Protocol counts (408→378), case study counts (440→433), version (v9.8.2→v9.8.3), version history entry
- `README.md` — Version badge, SDK version, changelog entry
- `AGENTS.md` — Version sync
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.8.2→9.8.3)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

## v9.8.2 (17 April 2026)

**Progressive Disclosure, Telemetry Foundation & Auto-Gen Indexes**

### Key Changes

#### Progressive Disclosure (Protocol 530 — Full Rollout)
- **`context_trigger` Migration**: All 26 example skills now have `context_trigger` frontmatter. Skills are dormant by default and activate only when the user's query matches trigger phrases (e.g., `circuit-breaker` activates on "losing streak", "tilt", "revenge trade"). Estimated ~40-60% token savings on skill metadata injection.

#### Telemetry Foundation
- **`log_invocation.py`** (NEW): `scripts/log_invocation.py` — Structured JSONL invocation logger. Tracks every workflow/skill/protocol invocation with timestamp, trigger source, session ID, and token counts. Outputs to `.athena/invocations.jsonl`. CLI and importable module.
- **Purpose**: After 30 days of collection, analyze the data to identify unused components for evidence-based archival (bottom 40% by invocation count). Replaces "vibe-based" pruning with data-driven pruning.

#### Auto-Generate Indexes (Pre-Commit Gate 4)
- **Gate 4** added to reference pre-commit hook (`scripts/hooks/pre-commit`): When protocol, skill, or workflow files are staged, the hook automatically regenerates the corresponding index files. Ensures DISCIPLINE Rule 3 ("no hand-maintained indexes") is mechanically enforced.

#### Version Drift Fix
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Version was stuck at v9.7.0 while all other surfaces were at v9.8.1. Fixed to v9.8.2. This is exactly the kind of drift that Gate 1 (Version Lint) was built to catch.

### Design Decisions

- `context_trigger` uses free-text comma-separated phrases rather than structured YAML arrays — this makes triggers readable in frontmatter and easy to grep. Pattern matching is fuzzy by design; false positives (loading an extra skill) are cheap, false negatives (missing a relevant skill) are expensive.
- Gate 4 is non-blocking (warnings only) — index generation failure should never prevent a commit. The gate's job is to auto-fix, not to enforce.
- `log_invocation.py` appends to a single JSONL file rather than per-session files. This makes analysis trivial (`cat | jq | sort`) and avoids the fragmentation that killed previous logging attempts.

### Files Changed

- `examples/skills/*/*/SKILL.md` — 26 files updated (added `context_trigger`)
- `scripts/log_invocation.py` — NEW
- `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` — Gate 4 added
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Version fix (v9.7.0 → v9.8.2)
- `README.md` — Version badge (v9.8.1 → v9.8.2), SDK version
- `AGENTS.md` — Version sync
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.8.1 → 9.8.2)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

## v9.8.1 (17 April 2026)

**Mechanical Enforcement — From Aspirational Rules to Pre-Commit Gates**

### Key Changes

#### Enforcement Architecture
- **Pre-Commit Hook** (NEW): `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` — Reference implementation of mechanical enforcement for DISCIPLINE.md rules. Three gates:
  - **Version Lint Gate**: Blocks commits if `README.md` or `AGENTS.md` contain version strings that don't match `pyproject.toml`. Prevents the most common failure mode (version drift across surfaces).
  - **Protocol Cap Gate**: Blocks commits if protocol count exceeds the cap. To add a new protocol, the commit message must contain `RETIRES: <protocol_name>`, forcing one-in-one-out discipline.
  - **Workflow Cap Gate**: Warns if workflow count exceeds the target threshold. Hard-blocks above a ceiling.
- **Override Protocol**: Include `DISCIPLINE_OVERRIDE` in commit message to bypass all gates. Overrides are automatically logged to `decisionLog.md` for 30-day review — accountability without rigidity.

#### Documentation
- **DISCIPLINE.md v2** (REWRITTEN): `docs/DISCIPLINE.md` — The "human discipline first" hypothesis was tested in the private workspace and failed: all 5 rules were simultaneously violated within 30 days. Updated to document the mechanical enforcement model, override protocol, and the Meta-Rule (no version bump without updating every public surface in the same commit).

### Design Decisions

- The pre-commit hook is provided as a *reference implementation* in `scripts/hooks/`, not auto-installed. Forkers install it manually (`cp scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit`) — this preserves the learning moment of understanding *what* it enforces.
- Override protocol requires `DISCIPLINE_OVERRIDE` in the commit message (not a flag, not a config toggle) — this makes overrides visible in `git log --grep` and creates a searchable audit trail.
- The hook uses `|| true` on bash arithmetic increments to prevent `set -e` from killing the script when `((WARNINGS++))` evaluates to 0→1 (a known bash gotcha).

### Verification

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Version lint (match) | ✅ Pass |
| Version lint (mismatch) | ✅ Blocks |
| Protocol cap (at limit) | ✅ Pass |
| Protocol cap (over limit, no RETIRES) | ✅ Blocks |
| Workflow cap (at target) | ✅ Warns |
| Override bypass | ✅ Logs + passes |
| Exit codes (warnings=0, errors=1) | ✅ Correct |

### Files Changed

- `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` — NEW (reference pre-commit hook)
- `docs/DISCIPLINE.md` — REWRITTEN (enforcement model v2)
- `README.md` — Version badge (v9.8.0 → v9.8.1), SDK version, changelog entry
- `AGENTS.md` — Version sync
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.8.0 → 9.8.1)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

## v9.8.0 (17 April 2026)

**Security Hardening, Structural Integrity, and Capability Engines**

### Key Changes

#### Security
- **RLS Vector Table Hardening** (NEW): `supabase/migrations/015_rls_vector_tables.sql` — Enables Row Level Security on all 12 core vector/memory tables. Locks access to `service_role` only. If a forker's anon key leaks, attackers get nothing. Previously, all tables were open to `anon` access.
- **Keychain Migration Script** (NEW): `scripts/env_keychain.sh` — macOS Keychain bridge that replaces plaintext `.env` files with OS-level encrypted storage. Commands: `store` (import .env → Keychain), `load` (export for `eval`), `verify` (check status).
- **CI Quality Gate** (NEW): `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — Automated pipeline with ruff linting, mypy type checking, pip-audit security scanning, silent exception detection, and pytest. Triggers on push/PR to main.

#### Structural Integrity
- **Protocol Domain-Prefix Naming**: All 131 numericprefix protocols renamed to collision-proof `[DOMAIN]-[NNN]-name.md` format (e.g., `BUS-106-name.md`, `RSC-52-name.md`). Resolves 6 numeric prefix collisions across domain directories.
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Deleted `requirements.txt`, `requirements-lite.txt`, `requirements-full.txt`. `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth. Dev dependencies updated: `pipreqs`/`pydeps` → `mypy`/`pip-audit`.
- **Hygiene Sweep**: Removed 8x `.DS_Store` files, 25x `__pycache__/` directories, and `athenad.log` (runtime log that was committed to repo).
- **DISCIPLINE.md** (NEW): `docs/DISCIPLINE.md` — Five stop-rules for sustainable growth (No New Tech Without Removing Old Tech, Workflow Cap, Protocol Cap, Context Ceiling, Single Source of Truth). Prevents unbounded complexity bloat.

#### Capability Engines
- **EVA — Evaluation Harness** (NEW): `tests/test_eval_harness.py` — 8-test golden prompt suite validating workspace structure, protocol naming hygiene, security templates, and governance docs. All 8 passing.
- **REC — Reconciliation Engine** (NEW): `scripts/reconcile_memory.py` — Scans memory surfaces for version skew, staleness, bloat, and cross-file contradictions. Outputs report to `.context/audit/reconciliation_report.md`.

### Design Decisions

- Version bumped from 9.7.0 → 9.8.0 (not 10.0) because this release is a hardening pass on existing architecture, not a new capability layer.
- Protocol renames are backwards-compatible — numeric-only references still work in semantic search. The domain prefix is additive metadata.
- `env_keychain.sh` uses generic key names (not private service identifiers) so forkers can adapt it to their own infrastructure.
- `DISCIPLINE.md` uses generic counts (24-workflow cap, 500-protocol cap) rather than the private repo's current operational numbers.

### Verification

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| `test_eval_harness.py` | 8/8 ✅ |
| Protocol collisions (post-rename) | 0 filename dupes ✅ |
| `athenad.log` in repo | Deleted ✅ |
| `.DS_Store` count | 0 ✅ |
| `__pycache__` count | 0 ✅ |
| `requirements*.txt` count | 0 ✅ |

### Files Changed

- `supabase/migrations/015_rls_vector_tables.sql` — NEW
- `scripts/env_keychain.sh` — NEW
- `scripts/reconcile_memory.py` — NEW
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — NEW
- `docs/DISCIPLINE.md` — NEW
- `tests/test_eval_harness.py` — REWRITTEN (from test_great_steal.py)
- `examples/protocols/**` — 131 files renamed (domain prefix)
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump + dev dep update
- `README.md` — Version badge
- `AGENTS.md` — Version + date sync
- `CLAUDE.md` — Version + date sync
- Deleted: `requirements.txt`, `requirements-lite.txt`, `requirements-full.txt`
- Deleted: `athenad.log`, 8× `.DS_Store`, 25× `__pycache__/`

## v9.7.0 (10 April 2026)

**Biological Analogy v2 & GTO Metrics Deep Sync**

### Key Changes

- **Biological Analogy Upgrade**: README and ARCHITECTURE.md standardized to the **7-tier** compositional hierarchy (was 6-tier in README). The README previously mapped Molecule → Protocol and Cell → Skill, compressing two distinct abstraction layers. Now correctly maps: Atom (Law) → Molecule (Rule/Constraint) → Cell (Protocol) → Tissue (Skill) → Organ (Cluster) → Organ System (System) → Organism (Athena). Matches the actual workspace hierarchy.
- **Metrics Sync**: Full GTO metrics pass across 8 files:
  - Protocols: 397 → 408 (ARCHITECTURE, GLOSSARY, ABOUT_ME)
  - Skills: 24 → 28 (ARCHITECTURE)
  - Case studies: 410 → 440+ (ARCHITECTURE, ABOUT_ME)
  - Sessions: 1,200 → 1,500+ (ARCHITECTURE, SPEC_SHEET)
  - Workflows: 53 → 66+ (ARCHITECTURE)
  - Scripts: 220 → 211 (corrected, ARCHITECTURE)
  - GLOSSARY key metrics: sessions 500→1,500+, protocols 241→408, scripts 97→211, embedded docs 800→2,100+
- **Date Sync**: All core files updated to 10 April 2026.
- **Version Sync**: All version references aligned to v9.7.0.

### Design Decisions

- The 7-tier model was already present in ARCHITECTURE.md but the README compressed it to 6 tiers. This release standardizes: the distinction between a Rule/Constraint (compound but non-executable) and a Protocol (executable with defined I/O) is architecturally meaningful and worth preserving in the public-facing documentation.
- Scripts count *decreased* from 220+ to 211 — reflects accurate filesystem count after pruning passes in v9.5.7–v9.6.6.

### Files Changed

- `README.md` — Version badge, date, biological analogy table (6→7 tier), SDK version
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Version, date, compositional hierarchy (counts + diagram), session counts, version history entry
- `docs/SPEC_SHEET.md` — Version, date, session count

## v9.6.6 (5 April 2026)

**GTO Metrics Sync & Deep Audit — Filesystem-Verified Counts**

### Key Changes

- **Protocol Count Sync**: Category-level counts corrected to match filesystem (Architecture 18→22, Decision 19→28, Engineering 13→18, Workflow 16→17). Total active 149, unchanged. Propagated to KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH, protocols/README, ABOUT_ME.
- **Workflow Count**: Updated 63→66 across 5 files (KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH, README). Reflects 3 new workflows added since v9.6.3 (/dream and others).
- **Protocol Index Session Count**: Updated 1,100+ → 1,500+ in `examples/protocols/README.md` (stale since v9.6.3).
- **ABOUT_ME Protocol Count**: Updated 120+ → 150+ (stale since initial release).
- **Version Sync**: All version references aligned to v9.6.6 across README, AGENTS.md, pyproject.toml, KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH, CHANGELOG.
- **Date Sync**: All core files updated to 5 April 2026.

### Design Decisions

- Category counts now use exact filesystem numbers rather than rounded-down estimates, since `find` commands are cheap and exact counts prevent credibility erosion.
- Conservative rounding retained at the README level (150+, 66+) to avoid micro-updates on every single file addition.

### Files Changed

- `README.md` — Version badge, date, SDK version, workflow count, changelog entry
- `AGENTS.md` — Version, date
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.6.5 → 9.6.6)
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md` — Version, date, workflow counts, category-level protocol counts, mermaid diagram counts
- `docs/ABOUT_ME.md` — Protocol count (120+ → 150+)

## v9.6.5 (31 March 2026)

**Claude Code Architectural Integration**

### Key Changes

- **Context Compactor v2.0** (UPGRADED): `examples/skills/workflow/context-compactor/SKILL.md` — Complete rewrite adopting Claude Code's 9-section summary template. Replaces the old 4-step compress workflow with a structured analysis scratchpad (`<analysis>` tags) that improves summary quality while consuming zero tokens in the final context window. Includes auto-continue rule and anti-pattern checklist.

- **Protocol 530 — Conditional Skill Activation** (NEW): `examples/protocols/architecture/530-conditional-skill-activation.md` — Path-based and context-triggered skill system. Skills with `context_trigger` frontmatter fields (`paths:`, `topics:`, `projects:`) are dormant by default and only activate when matching conditions are met. Estimated ~40-60% token savings on skill metadata in system prompts.

- **Coordinator Synthesis Discipline** (ADDED to `/416-agent-swarm`): `examples/workflows/416-agent-swarm.md` §6 — 4-phase workflow (Research → Synthesis → Implementation → Verification). Anti-delegation rule: orchestrators must never write "based on your findings" — they must synthesize worker output into a concrete implementation spec. Includes Continue vs. Spawn decision matrix and worker prompt requirements.

- **Analysis Scratchpad in `/end`** (ADDED): `examples/workflows/end.md` §0.5 — Before writing session logs, agents perform private analysis in `<analysis>` tags (chain-of-thought) that improves synthesis quality but gets stripped before output reaches persistent storage.

- **Validated Patterns** (ADDED to `/end`): `[V]` markers in session logs capture non-obvious approaches that worked. `shutdown.py` extracts these and appends to `Session_Observations.md § Validated Patterns` — preventing "cautious drift" where the system becomes overly conservative about proven approaches.

- **Token Budget Allocation** (ADDED to `/416-agent-swarm`): `examples/workflows/416-agent-swarm.md` §5 — Static per-role budget caps (Research: HIGH, Code Gen: MEDIUM, Review: LOW, Docs: LOW) to prevent expensive agents from crowding out cheap ones in shared-budget swarms.

### Version Sync

| File | Version |
|:-----|:--------|
| `pyproject.toml` | 9.6.5 |
| `README.md` badge | v9.6.5 |
| `AGENTS.md` | v9.6.5 |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | v9.6.5 |

## v9.6.4 (28 March 2026)

**Token Economy Mode — `/minmax` Workflow**

### Key Changes

- **`/minmax` Workflow** (NEW): `examples/workflows/minmax.md` — Session-level mode toggle that inverts the optimization function from `maximize(quality)` to `maximize(quality / tokens)`. Designed for pay-per-token pricing, context window pressure, or deliberate efficiency training. Composable: activate before `/start` or `/ultrastart` to constrain their boot behavior.

### The 4 Behavioral Rules

1. **Selective Boot**: Task-routing table replaces "load all modules." Core_Identity always loads; everything else is conditional on session objective. Saves ~50K tokens on `/ultrastart` boot.
2. **Per-Turn Discipline**: SNIPER default (upgrade only at Λ ≥ 15), max 1 search per turn at `--limit 3`, tables > bullets > prose.
3. **Dense Output Protocol**: Lead with the answer, no preamble, no restating the question. Quality floor unchanged — reduces volume, not reasoning depth.
4. **Micro Close Default**: Skip CANONICAL/PROJECTS updates unless session was substantive. Compressed checkpoint format.

### Estimated Savings

| Activity | Normal (/ultrastart) | Minmax (/ultrastart) | Reduction |
|:---------|:--------------------|:--------------------|:----------|
| Boot | ~60K tokens | ~8-12K tokens | ~80% |
| Per-turn (avg) | ~5-8K | ~2-4K | ~50% |
| Close | ~2K | ~300 | ~85% |
| 10-turn session | ~115K | ~30K | **~74%** |

### Design Decisions

- **Standalone workflow, not flags**: Law #4 (Modular Architecture) — new capability = new file, not conditional logic injected into 4 existing workflows. Zero maintenance cost when unused.
- **Inverted doctrine**: The Maximum Compute Doctrine (v3.0) optimises `maximize(quality)` because tokens are pre-paid on flat-rate. `/minmax` inverts to `maximize(quality/tokens)` when tokens have marginal cost. Both maintain the same quality floor.
- **No protocol needed**: Self-contained mode — activates, modifies behavior, deactivates at session end. Nothing else references it.

### Files Changed

- `examples/workflows/minmax.md` — NEW
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

## v9.6.3 (28 March 2026)

**Metrics Sync & Deep Audit — Filesystem-Verified Counts**

### Key Changes

- **Version Sync**: All version references aligned to v9.6.3 across README, AGENTS.md, pyproject.toml, KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.
- **Session Count**: Updated 1,100+ → 1,500+ (filesystem-verified: 1,569 session logs). Affects ABOUT_ME.md (3 references).
- **Case Study Count**: Updated 42 → 430+ (filesystem-verified: 431 case study files). Affects ABOUT_ME.md.
- **Protocol Count**: Updated 148+ → 149+ (filesystem-verified: 149 protocol files). Affects README, KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.
- **CHANGELOG Backfill**: Added missing v9.6.2 entry (committed but undocumented).
- **Date Sync**: All core files updated to 28 March 2026.

### Design Decisions

- Counts use conservative rounding (1,569 → "1,500+", 431 → "430+") to avoid needing updates on every minor addition.
- Protocol count now uses exact number (149+) since it changes less frequently.

### Files Changed

- `README.md` — Version badge, SDK version, protocol count, date, changelog entries
- `AGENTS.md` — Framework version, date
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.6.1 → 9.6.3)
- `docs/ABOUT_ME.md` — Session count (×2), case study count, compounding data reference
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md` — Version, date, protocol counts, concept count
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry + v9.6.2 backfill

---

## v9.6.2 (26 March 2026)

**ultrastart + ultraend GTO Upgrade — Cross-Domain Sweep & Insight Compounding**

### Key Changes

- **Mandatory Cross-Domain Sweep** (`/ultrastart`): Phase 2 now explicitly loads `PROJECTS.md` and `activeContext.md` to prevent tunnel vision during deep boot. Ensures pipeline awareness before entering focused work.
- **Decision Outcome Tracking** (`/ultraend`): New Phase 3 sub-step — log decision outcomes from the session, not just insights. Captures the feedback loop that calibrates future decisions.
- **Insight Compounding Chain** (`/ultraend`): Phase 4 now requires explicit propagation directives — where does each insight go? (CANONICAL, Protocol, Workflow, Session Observation). Prevents insights from dying in session logs.
- **Architecture Version History**: Updated ARCHITECTURE.md version table.

### Design Decisions

- Cross-domain sweep is mandatory (not optional) because the highest-value sessions often reveal cross-domain connections that aren't visible when context is siloed.
- Propagation directives force the question "where should this live?" — the most common failure mode is generating insights that never get filed.

### Files Changed

- `examples/workflows/ultrastart.md` — Phase 2 cross-domain sweep
- `examples/workflows/ultraend.md` — Decision tracking + propagation directives
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Version history update

---

## v9.6.1 (26 March 2026)

**The Ousen Protocol — Pre-Execution Battle Planning**

### Key Changes

- **`/battleplan` Workflow** (NEW): `examples/workflows/battleplan.md` — 7-phase pre-execution battle planning protocol for complex deliverables. Inspired by General Ou Sen's doctrine: "I only fight battles I can win." Introduces the **Double-Envelope Audit Architecture** — Red-Team #1 audits the *plan* (catches strategic failures before writing begins), Red-Team #2 audits the *output* (catches execution failures after writing). The pipeline: `Brief → Deep Research (scouts) → /battleplan → Red-Team #1 → Execute → Red-Team #2 → Humanize → Ship`.
- **Scout/General Sequencing**: Deep research agents (Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity) act as expendable scouts — gather intelligence in 5 minutes at near-zero cost. The premium agent (Athena) then designs the battle plan with full terrain knowledge. "Don't send the General to scout when you have scouts."
- **Examiner Anticipation Matrix**: Phase 3 war-games the evaluator's likely moves — what they're *really* looking for, where students typically fail, trap questions, unmarked minefields. The "opponent's game plan" is mapped before the first word is written.

### The 7 Phases

1. **Intelligence Briefing** — Digest deep research outputs, find consensus/contested positions, flag citation deserts
2. **Terrain Scan** — Read every source document, extract rubric/deadline/constraints
3. **Examiner's Game Plan** — War-game the evaluator's anticipated moves
4. **KSA Gap Map** — Post-research 🟢/🟡/🔴 gap assessment per section
5. **Battle Formation** — Military-style troop deployment (center/left/right wing with kill shots per section)
6. **Win Conditions & Risk Register** — Distinction vs Pass vs Fail markers + risk mitigations
7. **Commander's Intent** — One-line North Star directive that governs all execution decisions

### Design Decisions

- Deep research comes *before* the battle plan (not after) — scouts are cheap, the General's time is not. The 5-minute deep research cost is dominated by the value of a well-informed plan.
- The Double-Envelope architecture catches fundamentally different failure modes: strategic failures (wrong thesis, missing rubric criteria) are caught in Red-Team #1 before any writing begins, preventing costly rewrites. Execution failures (hallucinated citations, tone drift) are caught in Red-Team #2 post-writing, fixable with targeted edits.
- Battle Formation uses military terminology (center army, left/right wing, reserves, defensive positions) — this makes section-importance mapping visceral and immediately legible.

### Files Changed

- `examples/workflows/battleplan.md` — NEW
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `README.md` — Version badge (9.6.0 → 9.6.1), changelog entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.6.0 → 9.6.1)

## v9.6.0 (25 March 2026)

**The Outcome Economy — Labor Economics of Human Augmentation**

### Key Changes

- **Outcome Economy Concept Page** (NEW): `docs/concepts/Outcome_Economy.md` — The economic thesis for why AI-augmented operators earn more per hour while charging less per deliverable. Grounds the Bionic Unit philosophy in formal labor economics: utility maximisation (`U(C,L)` → `U(C,L,K)`), backward-bending labor supply curve, Ricardian comparative advantage within one person, and the Bionic Pricing Arbitrage (client pays 67% less, operator earns 233% more per hour).
- **Cross-References**: Updated Time Compression Thesis, Grace Protocol, KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH, and TAG_INDEX with Outcome Economy links. 7 new tags added (`#outcome-economy`, `#labor-economics`, `#backward-bending-supply`, `#comparative-advantage`, `#bionic-pricing`), 2 existing tags updated (`#flat-rate-ai`, `#human-augmentation`).
- **Concept Count**: 7 → 8 documented thesis pages.

### Design Decisions

- Titled "Outcome Economy" rather than "Labor Economics" because the labour-leisure model is a _mechanism_ — the concept page's thesis is about the _economic regime shift_ from output-based to outcome-based value.
- The "Third Good" extension (`U(C,L,K)`) is the novel contribution — standard labor economics models only have 2 goods. Adding K (capital/asset building) captures the asymmetry between augmented and unaugmented operators: freed hours enable upstream investment that shifts _future_ budget constraints.
- Backward-bending supply curve explanation uses the user's "enjoy life lor" phrasing (anonymised) as the intuition pump — makes formal economics accessible via lived experience.
- No separate case study — the bionic pricing arbitrage ($3K→$1K worked example) is embedded in the concept page itself because it's a _structural pattern_, not a single narrative.
- All examples fully anonymised: no client names, project codes, or assignment identifiers.

### Files Changed

- `docs/concepts/Outcome_Economy.md` — NEW
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md` — Count (7→8), new concept entry, new relationship entry
- `docs/TAG_INDEX.md` — 7 new tags, 2 updated tags, new concept entry
- `docs/concepts/Time_Compression_Thesis.md` — Cross-reference added
- `docs/concepts/Grace_Protocol.md` — Cross-reference added
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.5.8 → 9.6.0)

---

## v9.5.9 (24 March 2026)

**Iteration Arbitrage Framework — Consulting Delivery Model**

### Key Changes

- **Iteration Arbitrage Concept Page** (NEW): `docs/concepts/Iteration_Arbitrage.md` — The structural argument for why flat-rate AI lifts the iteration ceiling on complex problem-solving. Traditional consultants stop iterating when budget runs out, not when they find the answer. Builds on Maximum Depth Doctrine (vertical) by extending it horizontally (unlimited convergence loops per problem).
- **Case Study #7** (NEW): The Consulting Convergence Problem — 8 convergence loops for multi-stakeholder consulting at $375/session vs McKinsey's 3-4 at $30K/loop. Introduces the Paper-Reality Gap (convergent vs divergent problems), loop count scaling formula, and per-session pricing thesis.
- **Compounding Principle**: Updated to reference CS#7 (consulting loops compound context across iterations).

### Design Decisions

- Convergent vs Divergent problem taxonomy: assignments have correct answers (1 loop), consulting has least-wrong answers (N loops). The iteration count is a problem-type property, not an efficiency metric.
- Pricing implication: per-session pricing structurally correct for divergent problems because it aligns price with the iteration count — the variable that actually drives cost.
- Framework extends CANONICAL §260 (private repo) into public documentation.

### Files Changed

- `docs/concepts/Iteration_Arbitrage.md` — NEW
- `docs/CASE_STUDIES.md` — Case Study #7 added, Compounding Principle updated
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `docs/TAG_INDEX.md` — New tags and concept entries

---

## v9.5.8 (23 March 2026)

**Red-Team GTO Audit — Workspace Hardening & Hygiene**

### Key Changes

- **`/fix` Workflow** (NEW): Analyzes test failures from `/test` output, classifies them (config/code/infra/flaky), proposes fixes, and re-runs tests. Unblocks the `/test` → `/fix` self-healing chain that was referenced but undefined.
- **Confidence Model Fix** (`Athena_Profile.md`): Resolved duplication between §2.1 (inline rubric) and §7 (canonical rubric). §2.1 now cross-references §7, establishing a single source of truth.
- **Protocol Naming Standardization**: 30 protocol files renamed from Title_Case/SCREAMING_CASE/PascalCase to kebab-case convention. TAG_INDEX and SKILL_INDEX references updated.
- **Deduplication**: Full MD5 scan across 393 protocols found 2 byte-identical duplicates — removed `329-consiglieri-protocol.md` (dupe of P197) and `protocol-webflow-bridge.md` (dupe of P066).
- **Pruning Checklist** (`/audit` workflow): New Phase 4.5 "Inventory Hygiene Check" for `--deep` audit mode. Checks deprecated protocols, stale indexes, context size, and activeContext line count.
- **KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md**: Updated stale counts (405→391 protocols, 63→60 workflows, 28→26 skills).

### Design Decisions

- Red-team (Claude Opus 4.6) flagged 3 factual inaccuracies in its own report — wiring ratio was 43% (not 9.9%), WORKFLOW_INDEX was 2 days stale (not 18), and ad-hoc pruning existed (not absent). Only 5 of 12 recommendations accepted — rejected protocol health dashboard, hard cap on protocols, and `/router` workflow as anti-patterns under the "better search > less inventory" principle.
- Protocol number collisions (50+ pairs with same NNN prefix in different domain dirs) confirmed as namespace-only — unique content, just shared numbers. Not worth renumbering since `smart_search.py` discovery is semantic, not numeric.
- Pruning checklist embedded in `/audit` rather than creating a separate `/prune` workflow — avoids the maintenance overhead of another workflow while surfacing hygiene at the right moment.

### Files Changed

- `examples/workflows/fix.md` — NEW
- `.framework/v8.2-stable/modules/Athena_Profile.md` — §2.1 cross-reference fix
- `AGENTS.md` — Version bump (v9.5.7 → v9.5.8), `/fix` workflow added
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

---

## v9.5.7 (21 March 2026)

**Data Compounding Thesis & GTO Metrics Sync**

### Key Changes

- **Data Compounding Thesis**: New wiki page ([The Compounding Effect](../Athena-Public.wiki/The-Compounding-Effect.md)) + README data quality thesis + CASE_STUDIES compounding section + ABOUT_ME advantage #5. Core argument: the moat isn't the code — it's your data. Anyone can fork Athena; nobody can fork your sessions.
- **GTO Metrics Sync**: Version badges, SDK reference, protocol counts, session counts filesystem-verified and synced across README, ARCHITECTURE, SPEC_SHEET, pyproject.toml.
- **Star History Chart Fix**: Replaced broken `<picture>` element with reliable HTML dual-mode rendering (dark/light theme support).
- **Case Studies**: New CS-004 (NTU SDR Analysis) and CS-005 (Min-Max Purchasing Framework) added to CASE_STUDIES.md.
- **Meta-Game Thesis**: New concept doc (`docs/concepts/Meta_Game_Thesis.md`) — generic LLMs optimise within the game; Athena asks whether you should be playing that game at all.
- **Cross-Model Research Arbitrage Protocol (P527)**: Run identical prompts through ≥3 models, intersection = consensus truth, union minus intersection = novel insights.
- **Problem Authentication Gate**: P504 Gate 0 expansion — authenticate the problem before solving it.
- **Security**: Deep PnC audit (16+ scans, 4 files fixed), CANONICAL.md removed from tracking (contained private financial data).

### Design Decisions

- Data Compounding Thesis positioned as the answer to "what's the moat?" — the most common question from GitHub visitors. Empirical data > synthetic data > no data. The coupling data (1,200+ sessions of decisions, outcomes, corrections) is unreplicable.
- Star History chart uses the `<picture>` HTML element with `<source>` media queries for robust dark/light mode rendering across GitHub's themes.

### Files Changed

- `Athena-Public.wiki/The-Compounding-Effect.md` — NEW (wiki page, linked from README)
- `README.md` — Data quality thesis, Star History fix, version/date/counts sync
- `docs/CASE_STUDIES.md` — Compounding section, CS-004, CS-005
- `docs/ABOUT_ME.md` — Advantage #5 (data compounding)
- `docs/concepts/Meta_Game_Thesis.md` — NEW
- `examples/protocols/research/527-cross-model-research-arbitrage.md` — NEW
- `docs/USE_CASES.md` — Problem Authentication Gate refinement
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.5.6 → 9.5.7)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

---

## v9.5.6 (19 March 2026)

**Operator Optimization — The Phase 2 Thesis**

### Key Changes

- **CS-006** (NEW): [The Replacement Trap](../examples/case_studies/CS-006-the-replacement-trap.md) — 5 anonymized decision failures documenting the pattern where AI replaces human judgment instead of augmenting it. Root cause analysis ("Mode Confusion"), quantified impact (~$2,300 underpricing + 1 health risk + 1 positioning error), and the 3-Question Pre-Flight fix.
- **USER_DRIVEN_RSI.md**: New "Phase 2: Optimising the Operator" section. Documents the phase transition from AI system optimization to human operator optimization. Three axes: (1) supply richer training data, (2) constant calibration via outcome logging, (3) fine-tune personal thinking process via pre-flight checklist.
- **BEST_PRACTICES.md**: New §10 "Decision Sovereignty (The Pre-Flight Checklist)". Anti-pattern table, 3-question pre-flight, when-to-apply decision matrix. Quick Reference updated with new do/don't items.
- **README.md**: Phase 2 thesis referenced in the Human Augmentation section. Version, date, SDK version, and changelog updated.

### Design Decisions

- CS-006 is fully anonymized — no client, project, or domain identifiers. All references use generic framing ("technical report", "healthcare provider", "consulting engagement") to protect operational security.
- Phase 2 is positioned as an evolution of the Symbiotic RSI thesis, not a replacement. Phase 1 (building the AI) and Phase 2 (optimising the human) are complementary stages in the bilateral loop.
- Decision Sovereignty is placed as §10 in BEST_PRACTICES rather than as a standalone protocol — it's operational guidance for the user, not system behavior for the AI.

### Files Changed

- `examples/case_studies/CS-006-the-replacement-trap.md` — NEW
- `docs/USER_DRIVEN_RSI.md` — Phase 2 section added
- `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md` — §10 Decision Sovereignty, Quick Reference updated, date synced
- `README.md` — Version badge, date, SDK version, Phase 2 reference, changelog entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump (9.5.5 → 9.5.6)
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

## v9.5.5 (16 March 2026)

**Abundance Mindset Alignment & Workspace Hygiene**

### Key Changes

- **P529 Survival HUD Removed**: Deleted `examples/protocols/safety/529-survival-hud.md` — fear-based crisis output mode replaced by existing safety stack (Law #1 + Circuit Breaker + Threat Playbooks). Aligns workspace with thriving/abundance mindset over scarcity framing.
- **`/start` Workflow Fix** (`examples/workflows/start.md`): Removed P529 reference from the Survival routing chain. Chain now correctly terminates at P506 (GTO Execution).
- **Protocol Count**: 128 → 127 active (147 → 146 total including archived). Safety category: 7 → 6 protocols.

### Design Decisions

- P529 was never triggered in practice across 1,000+ sessions. Its function (crisis-mode output compression to ≤15 lines) is redundant with the existing Survival System routing chain (P509 → #14 → P519 → #15 → P521 → P520 → #8 → P506) which already handles crisis contexts with full analytical depth.
- The removal is philosophically aligned: Athena's safety architecture should protect through *better reasoning*, not through *output restriction*.

### Files Changed

- `examples/protocols/safety/529-survival-hud.md` — DELETED
- `examples/workflows/start.md` — P529 reference removed from routing chain
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump

## Protocol 525 v1.2 (14 March 2026)

**Red-Team Hardening — Prior Art & Limitations**

### Key Changes

- **Prior Art** (NEW §Prior Art in P525): Cynefin framework (Snowden, 1999) acknowledged as prior art. Delta table specifying what P525 adds beyond Cynefin: AI output posture specification, conviction-decisiveness split (P524), compound decomposition pipeline, band width / anchoring risk mapping.
- **README**: Added "Architecture, not oracle" clarification after the domain classification table — clarifies n=1 architecture-by-design posture and links to P525.
- **References**: Added Snowden (1999, 2007) to P525.

### Files Changed

- `examples/protocols/reasoning/525-cross-domain-weighting.md` — v1.1 → v1.2 (Prior Art section + References)
- `README.md` — n=1 architecture clarification

---

## Protocol 525 v1.1 (14 March 2026)

**Domain-Aware Output Calibration — Cross-Domain Weighting Upgrade**

### Key Changes

- **Output Calibration Table** (NEW §3.5): Maps what Athena *says* and what the human *does* per domain type. Deterministic → direct answer; Semi-deterministic → band with assumptions; Semi-stochastic → structural estimate with fragility warning + human handoff; Stochastic → honest "no estimate."
- **Band Width & Reliability** (NEW §3.6): Framework mapping band width, reliability, and anchoring risk per domain. Semi-stochastic estimates carry high anchoring risk — always packaged with basis, fragility warning, and handoff.
- **Type 5 Declaration**: Explicit framing that most real-world high-stakes problems are compound (mixed-domain) by default. The 4 domain types are atomic building blocks, not categories.
- **Worked Examples**: Added legal (corporate fraud plea bargain — 6 sub-problems across 4 domain types) and trading (EURUSD long — direction stochastic, SL/sizing deterministic). Original S24 Ultra example retained.
- **Anti-Patterns**: Added 2 new entries (anchoring risk, sub-problem blending).

### Files Changed

- `examples/protocols/reasoning/525-cross-domain-weighting.md` — v1.0 → v1.1
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry

---

## v9.5.4 (14 March 2026)

**Architecture Integrity Audit — Protocol Index & Routing Sync**

### Key Changes

- **Protocol Index** (`examples/protocols/README.md`): Full rewrite. Corrected stale counts from 109→128 active protocols, 13→15 categories. Added missing Trading (2 protocols) and Content (1 protocol) categories. Updated Featured Protocols to reflect architecturally significant entries (P504, P507, P511, P526, P138).
- **Cluster Index** (`examples/templates/cluster_index_template.md`): Wired P138 (Third Choice Generation) into Problem-Solving Engine (#15) with new triggers ("false binary", "only two options", "dilemma"). Wired P526 (Business Viability Assessment) + P511 into Distribution Engine (#10) with new triggers ("business model", "four fits", "viability", "pro forma").
- **Integrity Fix**: Protocol counts now consistent between `protocols/README.md` (128 active + 18 archived = 146), top-level `README.md` (146+), and `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Design Decisions

- P138 placed in Cluster #15 (Problem-Solving) rather than #9 (Strategic Reasoning) — false binary dissolution is a *framing* operation (upstream) not an *analysis* operation (downstream). It fires *before* options are evaluated, not after.
- P526 placed in Cluster #10 (Distribution Engine) rather than standalone — business viability assessment is part of the GTM pipeline. You assess viability before you distribute.
- Decision category dropped from 28→19 active protocols because the original count included 9 archived files. Reasoning jumped from 3→13 reflecting 10 protocols added since the original index was written.

## v9.5.3 (14 March 2026)

**Independent Cross-Model Audit — Strategy & Reasoning Protocols**

### Key Changes

- **Protocol 526** (NEW): Business Viability Assessment — The 3-Layer Stack (BMC → Four Fits → Pro Forma P&L). Mandatory pre-qualification gate for business models and client ventures. Validated across 4 empirical cases (FnB, tuition, web design, AI consulting).
- **Protocol 138** (NEW): Third Choice Generation (Kobayashi Maru). Meta-thinking protocol for dissolving false binaries. 5-step framework: name the binary → challenge the frame → generate third options → evaluate expanded set → identify systemic failure.
- **Cold Start Rule** (`BEST_PRACTICES.md`): New §9 — verify all code deliverables from a clean clone before submission. Catches hidden local state dependencies.
- **Protocol Count**: Bumped from 144+ to 146+.

### Design Decisions

- P526 is the _deep_ follow-up to P511 (Business Viability Trinity). P511 is the 3-question pre-filter ("is this worth investigating?"); P526 is the 3-layer assessment ("can this actually work?"). Complementary, not redundant.
- P138 placed in `reasoning/` not `strategy/` — false binary dissolution is a domain-general cognitive tool, not limited to business decisions.
- Cold Start Rule derived from A6 Q2b empirical failure — a delivered project that failed to boot on the client machine. Prevention time: 60 seconds vs 2-hour debug.

### Files Changed

- `examples/protocols/strategy/526-business-viability-assessment.md` — NEW
- `examples/protocols/reasoning/138-third-choice-generation.md` — NEW

## v9.5.2 (13 March 2026)

**Ollama Integration, Symbiotic RSI, Metrics Sync**

### Key Changes

- **Ollama Embedding Provider** (`vectors.py`): Added provider pattern — `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` env var selects between `gemini` (default, 3072 dims) and `ollama` (local, zero-cost, 768 dims). Configurable via `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` and `OLLAMA_EMBED_MODEL`. Fully backward compatible. Closes #29.
- **Symbiotic RSI Codification** (`USER_DRIVEN_RSI.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`): Renamed User-Driven RSI → Symbiotic RSI. Added thesis declaration, thermodynamic framing (open vs closed systems), moat analysis (coupling data as defensibility), and Unilateral vs Symbiotic comparison table.
- **Dual Pressure Model** (`BEST_PRACTICES.md`): New §0 best practice — accelerate agent mastery by running open-source projects (adversarial hardening) and paid projects (velocity validation) simultaneously.
- **Metrics Sync**: Full refresh of stale counts across `CAPABILITIES.md` (5 metrics), `BENCHMARKS.md` (case studies 42→417+), `TOP_10_PROTOCOLS.md` (P330 canonical name).
- **VECTORRAG.md Full Refresh**: Corrected embedding model name (`text-embedding-004` → `gemini-embedding-001`), updated all domain counts (sessions ~468→1,100+, protocols ~226→144+, etc.), added Ollama provider documentation.
- **Protocol Count**: Bumped from 141+ to 144+.

### Files Changed

## v9.5.1 (11 March 2026)

**Conviction-Decisiveness Split & Version Sync**

### Key Changes

- **Protocol 524** (NEW): Conviction-Decisiveness Split. Decouples epistemic conviction from operational decisiveness in semi-stochastic domains. Delivers precise setups while acknowledging outcome uncertainty.
- **`README.md`**: Embedded the conviction-decisiveness insight into the domain uncertainty table. Added compute recommendation for `/ultrastart` (suggesting MAX subscription plans for unbounded deep reasoning).
- **Protocol Count**: Bumped from 140+ to 141+.
- **Version Bump**: Badges, `pyproject.toml`, and this changelog updated to `v9.5.1`.

---

## v9.5.0 (11 March 2026)

**Adaptive Graph of Thoughts — Protocol 75 v5.0**

### Key Changes

- **Protocol 75 v5.0** (NEW): AGoT-Enhanced Parallel Reasoning. Upgrades static 4-track parallel reasoning to dynamic graph-based topology with recursive decomposition, confidence-based pruning, and adaptive convergence gates. Based on Pandey et al. (2025), arXiv:2502.05078.
- **`agot_orchestrator.py`** (NEW): Core AGoT implementation (~530 lines). `AGoTController` manages layered DAG construction, recursive sub-graph spawning, and 4-track persona integration. Three preset tiers: `lite` (Λ 21-40), `full` (Λ 41-60), `tracks` (Λ > 60).
- **Adaptive Convergence Gate**: Replaces fixed ≥85/100 threshold with agreement-adaptive scoring. High consensus → threshold 70. Low consensus → threshold 90 + reconciliation round.
- **`/ultrastart` Integration**: AGoT routing table added. Λ-based automatic mode selection during deep boot sessions.
- **Research Archive**: AGoT research findings archived to `docs/research/agot_research.md` with 7 key paper citations.

### Design Decisions

- AGoT is strictly scoped to `/ultrastart` sessions only — the latency and token cost are acceptable in System-2 deep reasoning mode but inappropriate for lightweight sessions.
- v4.0 (`parallel_orchestrator.py`) remains available as a fallback. v5.0 does not modify or delete it. The two coexist.
- Controller logic is deterministic Python, not LLM. The LLM does strategy/decomposition/resolution/synthesis; Python manages graph state, concurrency, and termination.
- Heritage-based node addressing (`depth-layer-position`) ensures unique identification across nested graphs.
- Inter-track agreement measurement drives adaptive convergence threshold — tracks that agree need less scrutiny; disagreeing tracks demand stronger evidence.

### Files Changed

- `examples/protocols/decision/75-synthetic-parallel-reasoning-v5.md` — NEW
- `scripts/core/reasoning/agot_orchestrator.py` — NEW

## v9.4.9 (10 March 2026)

**Deep Session Close — `/ultraend` Workflow**

### Key Changes

- **`/ultraend` Workflow** (NEW): System-2 deep close counterpart to `/ultrastart`. 6-phase sequence: Phase 0 (standard `/end` — safety net), Phase 1 (Cross-Session Pattern Scan — recurring themes, orphaned pendings, decision reversals across last 5 sessions), Phase 2 (CANONICAL Deep Reconciliation — mandatory framework bundling check), Phase 3 (Reflexion Archive — what worked/didn't/counterfactual), Phase 4 (Strategic Portfolio Review — priority alignment, stale project detection, next session seeding), Phase 5 (Shutdown Orchestrator).
- **Session Architecture Symmetry**: The boot/shutdown pair is now complete: `/start` ↔ `/end` (lightweight) and `/ultrastart` ↔ `/ultraend` (System-2 deep). Auto-triggers when session opened with `/ultrastart`, 5+ decisions made, or new frameworks discovered.

### Design Decisions

- `/ultraend` is additive over `/end`, not a replacement. Phase 0 executes the full `/end` sequence first — if synthesis fails, the session is still cleanly closed.
- The "Framework Bundling Check" (Phase 2, Step 3) catches when 3+ related insights should be named and filed as a coherent framework rather than individual data points.
- "Next Session Seeding" (Phase 4, Step 4) writes a `@seeded` hint to the checkpoint, giving `/start` or `/ultrastart` a head start on context loading.

### Files Changed

- `examples/workflows/ultraend.md` — NEW
- `README.md` — Version, date, changelog
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump

## v9.4.8 (10 March 2026)

**Boot/Shutdown Architecture Redesign**

### Key Changes

- **`/ultrastart` Workflow** (NEW): System-2 deep boot for cognitively intensive work (`/ultrathink`, complex multi-domain analysis). 4-phase sequence with ≤20K token budget: Phase 1 (Absolute Law — full `Core_Identity.md`), Phase 2 (Materialized Truth — `CANONICAL.md` + `PROJECTS.md`), Phase 3 (Recent State — last `activeContext.md` checkpoint), Phase 4 (Semantic Bridge — `smart_search.py` top 5-7 results for the user's stated objective). Includes complexity gate, optional objective string, and graceful degradation.
- **`/end` GTO v3 Rewrite**: Fixed the Source Reality Gap — `end.md` previously claimed "There is no separate session log file" but `shutdown.py` compiles from `session_logs/`. Established dual-write architecture: session logs (`session_logs/[DATE]-session-[N].md`) for `shutdown.py` compilation + `activeContext.md` checkpoint block for `/start` fast boot. Added `[S]`/`[U]` learning markers for `shutdown.py`'s `extract_learnings()`. Tightened micro-close path.
- **`quicksave.py` Triple-Lock Fix**: Changed governance check from `AND` (require both Semantic Search + Web Search) to `OR` (require either). The previous `AND` gate was a textbook Robustness Theater violation (Protocol 510) — forcing unnecessary web searches for local problems (CSS bugs, refactors) added ~10-15s latency per turn for zero retrieval value.

### Design Decisions

- `/ultrastart` Phase 3 is deliberately thin (~1K tokens) — recency ≠ relevance. Phase 4 (Semantic Bridge) gets the largest flexible budget (~5.5K tokens) because it's the only task-specific phase.
- `/end` dual-write is complementary, not competing: session logs feed the compilation pipeline; activeContext feeds the boot pipeline. Different consumers, different files.
- Triple-Lock `OR` condition means: local problem → Semantic Search only. External facts → Web Search only. ULTRA queries → both. Matches the blast radius heuristic.

### Files Changed

- `examples/workflows/ultrastart.md` — NEW
- `examples/workflows/end.md` — Rewritten (GTO v3)
- `scripts/quicksave.py` — Triple-Lock AND→OR
- `scripts/core/quicksave.py` — Triple-Lock AND→OR
- `examples/scripts/quicksave.py` — Triple-Lock AND→OR
- `README.md` — Version, date, Deep Boot mode, changelog
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump

---

## v9.4.7 (09 March 2026)

**Safety Documentation & Governance Hardening**

### Key Changes

- **`SAFETY.md`** (NEW): Clinical disclaimer, crisis contacts (US/UK/International), clear boundaries on limitations — addresses external audit feedback on therapeutic/financial claims.
- **`README.md`**: Safety disclaimer added to Use Cases section (inline with "$200/hr therapist" claim). Safety link added to header nav and footer. Version bumped. SDK version synced.
- **Governance Tests** (private): 24 MC/DC tests added for Triple-Lock and DoomLoopDetector. Test suite improved from 51 → 76 tests.
- **Compaction Pipeline** (private): Pre-compaction state flush (OpenClaw pattern), head/tail preservation constants in `compact_context.py` v3.0.
- **Git Hygiene** (private): Reflog expired, `git fsck` clean.

### Design Decisions

- Clinical disclaimer placed directly inline with the asymmetry callout (the most likely place a vulnerable user reads). Not hidden in a footer — must scan past it to reach use cases.
- Crisis contacts are international (US/UK/112), not region-specific, since the public repo serves a global audience.

### Files Changed

- `SAFETY.md` — NEW
- `README.md` — Safety disclaimer, version, footer
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump

## v9.4.6 (09 March 2026)

**Project Switchboard — Multi-Project GSD Orchestration**

### Key Changes

- **`/project` Workflow** (NEW): Multi-project switchboard with 5 commands (view, add, switch, close, triage). Internal/External zone split matches the mental model of personal vs. client work. Dependency tracking (`Depends On` column) surfaces cross-project blockers. Cross-zone capacity check flags when degraded Internal projects (health, energy) affect External capacity.
- **`PROJECTS.md` Template**: Structured markdown dashboard with visual phase bars (░▓), urgency/EV ranking, and GTD-style next actions. GSD mechanics applied at the portfolio level.
- **README.md**: Upgraded "Work & Projects" use case to feature multi-project orchestration as a core capability. Version badge, SDK version sync.
- **`/start` Integration**: `PROJECTS.md` added to Phase 2 adaptive loading table — auto-loads when user asks about projects or "what should I work on."
- **`/end` Integration**: Step 5 added — prompts for project state updates before shutdown (advance phases, update next actions, adjust urgency, archive completed projects).

### Design Decisions

- `PROJECTS.md` is **user state** (lives in `.context/`), not agent infrastructure (`.agent/`). The workflow template is agent behavior (`.agent/workflows/`).
- Project IDs use `I/E` prefix (`I1`, `E3`) for unambiguous Internal/External identification during `/project switch`.
- Token efficiency: Loading `PROJECTS.md` costs ~500 tokens vs ~5K tokens for conversational context recovery. Over 44 sessions, this saves ~200K tokens.

### Files Changed

- `examples/workflows/project.md` — NEW
- `README.md` — Version, use case, changelog, SDK version
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump

## v9.4.5 (09 March 2026)

**Two-Mode Session Architecture & Crisis Architecture Upgrade**

### Session Architecture

- **Two Session Modes**: Introduced Lightweight mode (skip `/start`, just chat, `/end` when done) and Full Boot mode (`/start` → Work → `/end`). Documented in `BEST_PRACTICES.md` and `MULTI_MODEL_STRATEGY.md`.
- **The Framework Tax**: New concept documenting why Athena's ~10K token system prompt is valuable overhead for complex tasks but unnecessary waste for simple ones. Provides clear decision heuristic for mode selection.
- **Orchestrator-Executor Pipeline**: Formal documentation of the Gemini (scoping) → Opus (execution) → Gemini (QA) workflow that cuts frontier token usage by 50-70%.
- **Updated Anti-Patterns**: Added 3 new anti-patterns (brain dumps on Frontier, `/start` for quick questions, raw client briefs to Frontier).
- **Updated Quick Reference**: Quick reference card now includes Lightweight mode and scoping/planning tasks.

### Crisis Architecture

- **Protocol 509 (Emotional Triage)**: First-contact protocol for crisis-flagged queries. Classifies emotional state before routing to cognitive systems.
- **Protocol 519 (Terminal Goal Elicitation)**: Extracts the user's actual desired end-state during crisis, preventing premature solution-jumping.
- **Protocol 520 (Blast Radius Calculator)**: Quantifies potential damage across dimensions (financial, relational, health, career, legal) before recommending action.
- **Protocol 521 (Crisis Domain Constraints)**: Hard-coded domain-specific safety rules for crisis contexts (e.g., never recommend leverage in financial panic).
- **Updated Survival System**: Cluster chain updated from `#14 → #3 → #15 → #8 → P506` to `P509 → #14 → P519 → #15 → P521 → P520 → #8 → P506`.

### Files Changed

- `docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md` — Rewrote §2 Session Discipline
- `docs/MULTI_MODEL_STRATEGY.md` — Added Session Modes, Framework Tax, Orchestrator-Executor Pipeline sections
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — Updated Survival system cluster chain, version history
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — This entry
- `README.md` — Version badge, date, How It Works diagram, changelog
- `pyproject.toml` — Version bump

## v9.4.3 (07 March 2026)

**Maintenance Release**: Version sync, file count corrections, date alignment.

### Key Changes

- **`AGENTS.md`**: Version synced from v9.4.1 → v9.4.3. Date updated.
- **`README.md`**: Protocol count corrected from "135+" → "138" (actual audited count). Script count corrected from "530+" → "540+" (actual: 539). Version badge, SDK version, and repo structure counts updated.
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Version bumped to 9.4.3.
- **Date Sync**: All core files updated to 07 March 2026.

---

## v9.4.2 (05 March 2026)

**Cognitive Architecture v2.1**: Introduced the first feedback loop (homeostatic pressure), competitive multi-system routing (LIDA Broadcast), failure memory (reflexion journaling), and agent-controlled memory management (memory paging).

### Key Changes

- **Protocol 517 (Homeostatic Pressure)**: Synthetic hormone system — when context saturation exceeds 80%, a scalar modifier forces SNIPER mode and suppresses expensive cognitive systems. Caps co-activation chains at depth 4. Triggers circuit breaker (P514) after ≥2 consecutive tool failures.
- **Protocol 515 (Reflexion Journaling)**: Failure memory stored via `[REFLEXION]` tags in quicksave. Captures what failed, why, and the corrective lesson. Retrievable via Exocortex to prevent recurring mistakes — the architecture's immune system.
- **Protocol 516 (Memory Paging)**: Agent-controlled page-in/page-out/pin/rewrite operations on working memory. Adapted from MemGPT to the prompt layer — enables active memory management during domain transitions.
- **LIDA Broadcast Routing**: When a query triggers ≥2 Cognitive Systems at comparable relevance, each System generates a 1-sentence framing proposal. Winner is broadcast to all Systems, preventing siloed routing on cross-domain queries.
- **Deterministic Exit Verification**: Trading clusters #3 (Risk Gate) and #4 (Execution) now require arithmetic proof — show the math, don't assert correctness.
- **Ebbinghaus Decay**: Maintenance cluster applies access-weighted decay to retrieval scores. Memories not accessed in >30 days receive a decay penalty; frequently co-activated procedural patterns receive permanence multipliers.
- **Context Clearing (Factory Pipeline)**: `spec-driven-dev` skill now treats the spec artifact as single source of truth after drafting — planning-phase context is discarded to prevent contamination during execution.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| New Protocols | 3 (P515, P516, P517) ✅ |
| Architecture Protocols Total | 20 ✅ |

## v9.4.1 (05 March 2026)

**Daemon Cleanup & PnC Audit**: Removed deprecated BackgroundIndexer/LightRAG pipeline from `athenad.py`, sanitized leaked private paths, and synchronized version drift across all docs.

### Key Changes

- **`athenad.py` Cleanup**: Removed dead `BackgroundIndexer` class (60 lines), pruned unused imports (`hashlib`, `threading`, `queue`, `subprocess`). The LightRAG vectorization pipeline has been deprecated — the daemon now focuses solely on metadata indexing.
- **PnC Sanitization**: Removed leaked private path `/Winston/` from `EXCLUDED_PATTERNS`. Removed circular `Athena-Public/` self-reference from `WATCH_DIRS`.
- **`AGENTS.md` Sanitization**: Replaced leaked private skills (`moltbook`, `fantasy-framework-detection`, `moltbook-registry`) with canonical public skills (`spec-driven-dev`, `deep-research-loop`, `red-team-review`, `context-compactor`). Updated version from `v8.2-stable` → `v9.4.1`.
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Updated Daemon section mermaid diagram and description table to reflect BackgroundIndexer removal. Added v9.4.1 to version history.
- **Version Sync**: `pyproject.toml` bumped to `9.4.1`.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| `pyproject.toml` | v9.4.1 ✅ |
| `athenad.py` syntax | Valid ✅ |
| PnC patterns removed | 2 ✅ |
| Stale skills replaced | 3 → 4 ✅ |

## v9.4.0 (04 March 2026)

**Biological Stack Architecture**: Upgraded routing layer from 3 components to a full biological architecture: 8 Cognitive Systems (Organ System), 15 Cognitive Clusters (Organs), and 5 new protocols (P504-P508).

### Key Changes

- **Cognitive Systems Layer (`P507`)**: Added a macro-routing layer above clusters. 8 systems map to human need archetypes: Survival, Life Decision, Trading, Social, Execution, Growth, Learning, and Maintenance.
- **Intent Classifier (`P508`)**: Replaced flat keyword matching with an 8-question top-down diagnostic tree that routes queries to the correct Cognitive System.
- **`CLUSTER_INDEX.md`**: Updated from 3 starter clusters to the full 15-cluster production map. Linked all clusters to their parent Cognitive Systems.
- **Problem Diagnostics (`P504`)**: New 5-gate problem framing framework to prevent solving the wrong problem.
- **`ensure_env.sh` Fix**: Script now falls back to system Python if no `.venv` is found, reducing onboarding friction for users avoiding virtual environments.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Cognitive Systems | 8 |
| Cognitive Clusters | 15 |
| New Protocols | 5 |
| `pyproject.toml` | v9.4.0 |

## v9.3.1 (03 March 2026)

**Cross-Model Audit Fixes**: Resolved 4 missing GitHub releases (v9.2.7–v9.3.0), corrected stale file count claims, relocated Windows compatibility section, synced dates.

### Key Changes

- **File Count Correction** (`README.md`): Updated "370+ Markdown" → "350+" (actual: 354) and "230+ Python scripts" → "600+" (actual: 651). Counts drifted after v9.2.9 dead-skill pruning.
- **Windows Section Relocation** (`README.md`): Moved dangling `## Windows Compatibility` from below the footer into a collapsible `<details>` block under Quickstart.
- **GitHub Release Sync**: Created v9.3.1 release covering v9.2.7–v9.3.0 changelog summaries.
- **Date Sync**: Updated README and CHANGELOG dates to 03 March 2026.

---

## v9.3.0 (02 March 2026)

**Onboarding Friction Audit**: Restructured dependencies, added virtual environment instructions, and fixed 6 onboarding blockers for new users.

### Key Changes

- **Dependency Restructuring** (`pyproject.toml`): Moved `torch`, `sentence-transformers`, `flashrank`, `dspy-ai`, `anthropic`, `supabase`, `google-generativeai` from core dependencies to optional groups (`[search]`, `[cloud]`, `[full]`). Default `pip install -e .` now completes in ~30s without downloading 2GB of PyTorch.
- **Virtual Environment Instructions** (`README.md`, `GETTING_STARTED.md`, `FAQ.md`): Added explicit `python3 -m venv .venv` step to Quickstart. Prevents PEP 668 `externally-managed-environment` errors on macOS Homebrew and Ubuntu 23.04+.
- **Two-Tier Install Path** (`README.md`): Lightweight install (default) vs `pip install -e ".[full]"` (vector search + reranking).
- **PEP 668 Troubleshooting** (`FAQ.md`): New troubleshooting entry for the most common install blocker.
- **Stale Path Fix** (`examples/workflows/start.md`): Replaced hardcoded `file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/...` absolute paths with relative paths.
- **URL Fix** (`init.py`): Fixed `[AUTHOR]87` placeholder in init output URL.
- **`requirements-lite.txt`** (NEW): Minimal dependency file for users who want the core framework without ML deps.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Core install deps | 5 (was 11) ✅ |
| Install time (default) | ~30s (was 5-10 min) ✅ |
| PEP 668 addressed | 3 docs ✅ |
| Stale paths fixed | 3 ✅ |

---

## v9.2.9 (02 March 2026)

**Ultrathink v4.1 HITL Bypass + Micro-Pruning**: Added Human-in-the-Loop manual execution path to `/ultrathink`, pruned 10% dead skills for 100% cognitive cluster coverage, and fixed all broken references.

### Key Changes

- **Ultrathink v4.1**: Added Option B (HITL Manual Sandbox) — users can execute the 4 parallel reasoning tracks directly in the Gemini UI at zero API cost, then paste outputs back.
- **Micro-Pruning**: Removed `ui-ux-pro-max/` workflow (skill deleted from private repo). Fixed broken `file://` path in `refactor-code.md`.
- **`generate_skill_index.py`**: Removed dead `sickn33_collection` vendor block (referencing deleted submodule).
- **Cognitive Cluster Coverage**: Updated from 19/21 (90%) to 19/19 (100%) — all orphan skills eliminated.
- **Orchestrator v4.1**: Top-level imports, modern type hints (`dict`/`list`/`tuple`), rate-limit retry with 30s backoff, async deadlock fix.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Broken references fixed | 4 ✅ |
| Security scans passed | 3/3 ✅ |
| Cluster coverage | 100% ✅ |
| Lines removed (net) | -4,192 ✅ |

## v9.2.8 (27 February 2026)

**Skill Template Expansion**: Added 5 starter skill templates across 4 categories for new Antigravity users. Skills are copy-paste ready — `cp -r examples/skills/<skill> .agent/skills/`.

### New Skills

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `examples/skills/coding/spec-driven-dev/` | Build a design spec before writing code |
| `examples/skills/research/deep-research-loop/` | Structured multi-source research workflow |
| `examples/skills/quality/red-team-review/` | Adversarial QA review for any artifact |
| `examples/skills/decision/mcda-solver/` | Multi-criteria decision matrix calculator |
| `examples/skills/workflow/context-compactor/` | Compress context to stay within token limits |

### Other Changes

- **`examples/skills/README.md`**: Rewritten with full directory tree, AG Quick Start instructions, and skill creation guide.

---

## v9.2.7 (26 February 2026)

**Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock + Tier 0 Context Summaries**: Engineered the min-latency × max-effectiveness optimization. The Triple-Lock is no longer a flat tax on every query — it's now risk-proportional with three tiers. Boot sequence gains zero-cost context pre-computation.

### Key Changes

- **Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock** (`governance.py`): Added `RiskLevel` enum (SNIPER / STANDARD / ULTRA). SNIPER queries (Λ < 10) bypass mandatory search — direct answer. STANDARD/ULTRA enforce full Triple-Lock. Default is STANDARD (robustness bias: `cost(false_negative) >> cost(false_positive)`). Risk level auto-resets after each verification.
- **Tier 0 Context Summaries** (`context_summaries.py`, NEW): Pre-computes 500-char compressed summaries of all 6 Memory Bank files at boot. Uses hash-based delta detection — only regenerates when source changes. Cached to `.agent/state/context_cache/`. Zero API cost.
- **Boot Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.py`): Context summary generation integrated as parallel worker #7 in the ThreadPoolExecutor. Zero sequential boot latency added.
- **REFERENCES.md**: Added 3 new academic citations (Shannon, Satisficing, Antifragility).
- **README**: Updated tech stack routing description to "Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock".

### Design Principles (Three Laws)

1. **Measure latency over the full cycle, not per-response.** Rework is the real latency tax.
2. **Phase-separate classification from execution.** Fast routing, robust processing. Never blend.
3. **When the classifier is uncertain, always round toward robustness.** The cost asymmetry makes this the only rational default.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Governance SNIPER bypass | Verified ✅ |
| SNIPER auto-reset to STANDARD | Verified ✅ |
| STANDARD/ULTRA enforcement | Verified ✅ |
| Context summaries (6/6 files) | Pre-computed ✅ |
| Cache retrieval | Functional ✅ |
| All new code | Lint-clean ✅ |

## v9.2.6 (25 February 2026)

**Kilo Code + Roo Code IDE Integration**: Expanded agent compatibility to include Kilo Code and Roo Code. Fixed Windows encoding issue.

### Key Changes

- **IDE Support**: Added `athena init --ide kilocode` and `athena init --ide roocode` commands.
- **`COMPATIBLE_IDES.md`**: New documentation page listing all supported IDEs with setup instructions.
- **Windows Encoding Fix**: Resolved UTF-8 encoding issue on Windows platforms.
- **Issue #19**: Closed (IDE compatibility question).

---

## v9.2.5 (24 February 2026)

**Life Integration Protocol Stack + Formal Proof Standard**: Extended the reasoning pipeline from domain-specific rigor to domain-general life integration. New protocols for cross-domain constraint propagation, personalized learning, and emotional auditing.

### Key Changes

- **Protocol 381 (Formal Proof Standard)**: New — 6 rules for mathematical proofs and mechanism design (Derive Never Assert, Steelman Alternatives, Numerical Examples, Scope Boundaries, Adversarial Robustness, Dynamic Extensions).
- **Protocol 382 (Cross-Domain Constraint Propagation)**: New — prevents domain-siloed advice by auto-surfacing time/energy/money conflicts across life domains.

---

## v8.1-Performance (30 January 2026)

**Semantic Cache & Latency Optimization**: Implemented true semantic caching for intelligent query reuse.

### Key Changes

- **Semantic Caching**: Upgraded `QueryCache` to store query embeddings and perform cosine similarity matching (threshold 0.90). Similar queries now return cached results instantly.
- **Search Latency**: Reduced from 30s+ to <5s (exact match) and ~0s (semantic match).
- **Pre-Warming**: Boot sequence now pre-caches 3 "hot" queries (`protocol`, `session`, `user profile`) for instant first-search response.
- **GraphRAG Optimization**: Added `--global-only` flag to skip redundant local model loading.

### Verification

| Query Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| First Search | 30s+ (hanging) | **4.71s** |
| Exact Cache Hit | N/A | **~0.00s** |
| Semantic Cache Hit | N/A | **~0.00s** |

- **Functional Boot Orchestrator**: Replaced mock `lambda: True` stubs with real logic that:
  - Creates `session_logs/` directory structure
  - Generates timestamped session log files
  - Verifies Core_Identity.md integrity (SHA-256)
  - Primes semantic memory (if Supabase configured)
- **`examples/framework/Core_Identity.md`** (NEW): Sanitized Laws #0-6, Committee of Seats, Λ scoring
- **MANIFESTO.md**: Added "Bionic Unit" and "Law #6: Triple-Lock" sections
- **RISK_PLAYBOOKS.md**: Added Tier Classification legend (Tier 1/2/3 with icons)
- **Metrics**: Sessions 810, Protocols 285

### Philosophy

*From*: "Here is the author's Brain."
*To*: "Here is the Framework to Build Your Own Brain."

The public repo now provides the *engine*, not just the *manual*.

---

## v1.2.8 (06 January 2026)

**Grand Alignment Refactor**: Supabase schema hardened (11 tables + RLS), Memory Insurance layer stabilized.

### Key Changes

- **Metrics Corrected**: Protocols audited to 285, sessions at 768, scripts at 122
- **Memory Insurance**: Formalized the concept of Supabase as disaster recovery layer, not just search
- **Schema Hardening**: All 11 Supabase tables now have RLS enabled and hardened search paths

**Rationale**: The previous protocol count (332) included archived items. This release establishes accurate canonical metrics.

---

## v1.2.6 (05 January 2026)

**Stats Sync**: 605 sessions, 277 protocols, 119 scripts

### Backend Refactor: `athena.memory.sync`

Major architectural cleanup of the Supabase sync pipeline:

- **`supabase_sync.py`**: Refactored to use the `athena` SDK pattern. Cleaner separation between embedding generation and database operations.
- **`public_sync.py`**: New tool for sanitized sync to `Athena-Public`. Ensures private memories never leak to the public repository.
- **`athena.tools.macro_graph`**: Added macro-level knowledge graph tooling for visualizing cross-file relationships.

**Rationale**: The previous sync scripts were monolithic and tightly coupled. This refactor enables:

- Independent testing of embedding vs. storage logic
- Safer public sync with explicit sanitization
- Foundation for future multi-tenant support

### Governance: Cognitive Profile Refinements

Integrated red-team feedback into Athena's cognitive profile:

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Bionic vs Proxy Mode** | Ambiguous distinction | Explicit: Bionic = independent thinking, Proxy = drafting voice |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Informal | Percentages require empirical data + falsification checks |
| **Dehumanizing Language** | Hard invariant | Relaxed for biological/predatory frames when contextually appropriate |

**Source**: External red-team audit (Session 560-571)
