# Athena Changelog

> **Last Updated**: 1 July 2026

This document provides detailed release notes. For the brief summary, see the README changelog.

> **Note**: Versions v1.0–v1.6 predate the v8.x versioning scheme adopted in January 2026. The version jump reflects a complete architectural rewrite, not skipped releases.

---

## v9.9.5 (1 July 2026)

**Sync & Hygiene Pass**: Closed drift between this repo and the private reference implementation, and expanded protocol coverage.

### Key Changes

- **RLS Security Fix**: `supabase/migrations/017_unified_document_chunks.sql` was missing the Row Level Security policy on `document_chunks` that the private repo added on 2026-06-30. A fresh deploy from this repo would have shipped the table readable by `anon`/`authenticated` roles. Added the matching `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + service-role-only policy.
- **Version Reconciliation**: `pyproject.toml` and `athena.yaml` were stuck at `9.9.1`/`9.5.6` while this CHANGELOG had already moved to v9.9.4 — all three now agree.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md Count Fix**: The reference-architecture diagram cited stale private-repo counts and pointed at a `CAPS.json` file that isn't part of this repo. Updated to the private repo's current counts and clarified what that file actually is.
- **5 New Protocol Categories**: Added `diagnostics/`, `communication/`, `creation/`, `marketing/`, and `singapore/` (36 files) — protocols total 152→187, categories 16→21. Every file was individually reviewed; 12 required redacting real names/usernames/dollar amounts/case nicknames before shipping, and 6 files were excluded outright as too personal/clinical to publish even sanitized (see `public_manifest.yaml` for the per-category review note).

---

## v9.9.4 (21 June 2026)

**Retrieval Reliability**: Closed the gap between the v9.9.3 retrieval *docs* and the shipped *code*, and fixed a crash in the advertised reranker.

### Key Changes

- **Reranker Backend Fix**: The CrossEncoder reranker forced onto the PyTorch backend (`USE_TF=0`). It was probing for TensorFlow, importing it (~20s), then crashing on Keras 3 (`install tf-keras`) — which made `--rerank` exceed its subprocess timeout and return empty. Reranked candidates are now capped at 12 to bound the call.
- **Chunk-Level Architecture Landed in Code**: The `document_chunks` table (`vector(3072)`) and the `search_all_vectors` RPC are now shipped as migrations (016, 017) alongside the chunk-level `sync.py` and `gemini-embedding-001` (3,072-dim) embeddings in `vectors.py`. Previously these were described in the docs but the shipped code still ran the older document-level path. Code and schema now ship together so a fresh clone is self-consistent.
- **Sync Durability**: Chunks are embedded *before* the destructive delete, so a transient embedding/network failure can no longer leave a file with its chunks deleted and no replacement.
- **Archive Index Guard**: `/archive` paths are excluded from the semantic index so dead/frozen content can't pollute retrieval.

> **Upgrade note**: Existing deployments should re-run a sync to repopulate `document_chunks` at 3,072 dims (per the documented 768→3,072 migration). Fresh clones are consistent out of the box.

---

## v9.9.3 (19 June 2026)

**Retrieval Stack r2**: Brought the public retrieval docs in line with the live engine — the largest retrieval-architecture update since GraphRAG's removal.

### Key Changes

- **Chunk-Level Embeddings**: Retrieval moved from one-vector-per-file to **chunk-level** embeddings — 4,000-character windows with 400-character overlap, stored in a `document_chunks` table (~5,700 chunks from ~850 source documents). Sharper local recall on large session logs and protocols. See [VECTORRAG.md → Chunk-Level Embeddings](VECTORRAG.md#chunk-level-embeddings).
- **Embedding Model Migration**: `text-embedding-004` → **`gemini-embedding-001`** (3,072-dim).
- **CrossEncoder Reranker**: Added a second-stage **CrossEncoder (sentence-transformers)** reranker that re-scores fused `(query, candidate)` pairs jointly after RRF. New doc: [RERANKER.md](RERANKER.md).
- **Live Web Grounding**: Optional real-time web results (DuckDuckGo scrape) are now **fused into RRF** at weight 2.8, interleaving live facts with local memory rather than living in a separate tool.
- **pgvector Exact-Scan Documented**: `ivfflat` is capped at 2,000 dims and is unavailable at 3,072 — Athena runs an **exact sequential scan** (sub-ms under ~10k records). Documented in VECTORRAG.md.
- **Script Hygiene**: Purged stale GraphRAG scripts (`lightrag_wrapper.py`, `query_graphrag.py`) that contradicted the v9.9.1-gto GraphRAG removal. Doc script references corrected to `smart_search.py` / `sync.py`.
- **Factual Corrections (README + schema)**: Embedding dimension `768` → **`3072`** (matched `MASTER_SCHEMA.sql` `vector(3072)`); reranker label `FlashRank` → **cross-encoder** (matched `reranker.py`/CAPABILITIES); schema vector-model comment `text-embedding-3-large` → **`gemini-embedding-001`**.
- **Model Version Sync**: Current-state references `Claude Opus 4.7` → **`4.8`** across all public surfaces (historical changelog entries preserved).
- **Count Reconciliation**: README shipped-count claims aligned to actual `examples/` contents — **152 protocols / 16 categories**, **39 skills**, **163 reference scripts** (were 160+/24, 38–40, 165).
- **Internal Link Integrity Sweep**: Repaired **473 broken internal links** (~49% of all links) down to **0 real breaks** (remaining flagged links are wiki-relative and resolve on the GitHub wiki). Root causes fixed: (a) protocol-rename drift — old numeric links (`75-…`) remapped to the prefixed scheme (`DEC-75-…`, `VER-171-…`, `WFL-130-…`); (b) **141 leaked `file://` absolute paths** (pointing at the author's local workspace) converted to relative links or delinked; (c) removed duplicate `wiki/` and `docs/wiki/` trees (canonical wiki is `Athena-Public.wiki/`); (d) fixed a scrub-corrupted portfolio URL in `docs/protocols/content/220`.
- **CI Link Enforcement**: Added `.github/scripts/check_links.py` (resolves links against both the source dir and repo root, skips externals + wiki-relative links) and wired it into `link-checker.yml`. The previous shell step counted failures in a subshell and never failed the build; CI now **exits non-zero on any dead internal link**, so rename drift is caught on push.
- **TAG_INDEX Trim**: Replaced the stale 119-line hand-maintained reverse-index (a private-system artifact) with a concise concept stub. Inbound references stay valid; the bloat and partial breakage are gone.
- **Date Bump**: All touched docs updated to 19 June 2026.

---

## v9.9.2-sync (17 June 2026)

**Count Refresh + TOP_10 Rerank**: Synchronized all public documentation to current system state.

### Key Changes

- **TOP_10_PROTOCOLS.md Rewrite**: Re-ranked from theoretical importance to empirically-validated behavioral impact. 5 protocols promoted (PAT-574 Substance Decode, P003 Revealed Preference, MP-15 Preparation Asymmetry, BUS-96 Income Hierarchy, DEC-330 Aoy's Fried Rice), 5 demoted. MCDA criteria updated with new "Empirical Behavioral Impact" dimension (30% weight).
- **Count Sync**: Protocols 402 active / 34 archived / 436 total (was 400/32/432). Skills 41 active (was 40). Scripts 253 (was 251). Memory files 3,797 (was 3,729). CANONICAL tiers updated (40 T1, 156 T2, 3 T3).
- **Session Count Normalization**: Standardized to "1,800+" across all docs (was inconsistent between "1,500+", "1,800+", "1,900+").
- **Date Bump**: All touched docs updated to 17 June 2026.

---

## v9.9.2 (10 June 2026)

**Privacy Hard Wall + Mechanical Accountability**: Hardened the public-release pipeline and added structural accountability infrastructure.

### Key Changes

- **Allowlist Deploy Model**: Replaced the blocklist (`.syncignore`) sync model with an explicit allowlist (`examples/config/public_manifest.example.yaml`). Files not listed are blocked by default — the safe failure direction is over-blocking, not over-exposing.
- **Pre-Deploy Scanner** (`scripts/pre_deploy_scan.sh`): 3-gate mandatory pre-flight — Gate 1 secrets/API keys (hard abort), Gate 2 PII heuristics (review warnings), Gate 3 blocked file patterns (hard abort).
- **Deploy Workflow v2.0** (`examples/workflows/deploy.md`): Documents the full allowlist pipeline, sanitization protocol ("Consent Wall"), and explicit never-publish categories.
- **Behavioral Accountability Surface**: `/start`, `/ultrastart`, `/end` now read/write `.agent/state/accountability_status.json` — a mechanical commitment-tracking loop (boot reads → surfaces → close writes). Advisory only; no gates.

---

## v9.4.0 (04 March 2026)

**Biological Stack Architecture**: Upgraded routing layer from 3 components to a full biological architecture: 8 Cognitive Systems (Organ System), 15 Cognitive Clusters (Organs), and 5 new protocols (P504-P508).

### Key Changes

- **Cognitive Systems Layer (`P507`)**: Added a macro-routing layer above clusters. 8 systems map to human need archetypes: Survival, Life Decision, Trading, Social, Execution, Growth, Learning, and Maintenance.
- **Intent Classifier (`P508`)**: Replaced flat keyword matching with an 8-question top-down diagnostic tree that routes queries to the correct Cognitive System.
- **`CLUSTER_INDEX.md`**: Updated from 3 starter clusters to the full 15-cluster production map. Linked all clusters to their parent Cognitive Systems.
- **Problem Diagnostics (`P504`)**: New 5-gate problem framing framework to prevent solving the wrong problem.
- **`ensure_env.sh` Fix**: Script now falls back to system Python if no `.venv` is found, reducing onboarding friction for users avoiding virtual environments.

### Verification

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Cognitive Systems | 8 |
| Cognitive Clusters | 15 |
| New Protocols | 5 |
| `pyproject.toml` | v9.4.0 |

## v9.3.1 (03 March 2026)

**Cross-Model Audit Fixes**: Resolved 4 missing GitHub releases (v9.2.7–v9.3.0), corrected stale file count claims, relocated Windows compatibility section, synced dates.

### Key Changes

- **File Count Correction** (`README.md`): Updated "370+ Markdown" → "350+" (actual: 354) and "230+ Python scripts" → "600+" (actual: 651). Counts drifted after v9.2.9 dead-skill pruning.
- **Windows Section Relocation** (`README.md`): Moved dangling `## Windows Compatibility` from below the footer into a collapsible `<details>` block under Quickstart.
- **GitHub Release Sync**: Created v9.3.1 release covering v9.2.7–v9.3.0 changelog summaries.
- **Date Sync**: Updated README and CHANGELOG dates to 03 March 2026.

---

## v9.3.0 (02 March 2026)

**Onboarding Friction Audit**: Restructured dependencies, added virtual environment instructions, and fixed 6 onboarding blockers for new users.

### Key Changes

- **Dependency Restructuring** (`pyproject.toml`): Moved `torch`, `sentence-transformers`, `flashrank`, `dspy-ai`, `anthropic`, `supabase`, `google-generativeai` from core dependencies to optional groups (`[search]`, `[cloud]`, `[full]`). Default `pip install -e .` now completes in ~30s without downloading 2GB of PyTorch.
- **Virtual Environment Instructions** (`README.md`, `GETTING_STARTED.md`, `FAQ.md`): Added explicit `python3 -m venv .venv` step to Quickstart. Prevents PEP 668 `externally-managed-environment` errors on macOS Homebrew and Ubuntu 23.04+.
- **Two-Tier Install Path** (`README.md`): Lightweight install (default) vs `pip install -e ".[full]"` (vector search + reranking).
- **PEP 668 Troubleshooting** (`FAQ.md`): New troubleshooting entry for the most common install blocker.
- **Stale Path Fix** (`examples/workflows/start.md`): Replaced hardcoded `file:///Users/[AUTHOR]/...` absolute paths with relative paths.
- **URL Fix** (`init.py`): Fixed `[AUTHOR]87` placeholder in init output URL.
- **`requirements-lite.txt`** (NEW): Minimal dependency file for users who want the core framework without ML deps.

**Ultrathink v4.1 HITL Bypass + Micro-Pruning**: Added Human-in-the-Loop manual execution path to `/ultrathink`, pruned 10% dead skills for 100% cognitive cluster coverage, and fixed all broken references.

### Key Changes

- **Ultrathink v4.1**: Added Option B (HITL Manual Sandbox) — users can execute the 4 parallel reasoning tracks directly in the Gemini UI at zero API cost, then paste outputs back.
- **Micro-Pruning**: Removed `ui-ux-pro-max/` workflow (skill deleted from private repo). Fixed broken `file://` path in `refactor-code.md`.
- **`generate_skill_index.py`**: Removed dead `sickn33_collection` vendor block (referencing deleted submodule).
- **Cognitive Cluster Coverage**: Updated from 19/21 (90%) to 19/19 (100%) — all orphan skills eliminated.
- **Orchestrator v4.1**: Top-level imports, modern type hints (`dict`/`list`/`tuple`), rate-limit retry with 30s backoff, async deadlock fix.

### Verification

## v9.2.8 (27 February 2026)

**Skill Template Expansion**: Added 5 starter skill templates across 4 categories for new Antigravity users. Skills are copy-paste ready — `cp -r examples/skills/<skill> .agent/skills/`.

### New Skills

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `examples/skills/coding/spec-driven-dev/` | Build a design spec before writing code |
| `examples/skills/research/deep-research-loop/` | Structured multi-source research workflow |
| `examples/skills/quality/red-team-review/` | Adversarial QA review for any artifact |
| `examples/skills/decision/mcda-solver/` | Multi-criteria decision matrix calculator |

### Other Changes

- **`examples/skills/README.md`**: Rewritten with full directory tree, AG Quick Start instructions, and skill creation guide.

---

## v9.2.7 (26 February 2026)

**Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock + Tier 0 Context Summaries**: Engineered the min-latency × max-effectiveness optimization. The Triple-Lock is no longer a flat tax on every query — it's now risk-proportional with three tiers. Boot sequence gains zero-cost context pre-computation.

### Key Changes

- **Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock** (`governance.py`): Added `RiskLevel` enum (SNIPER / STANDARD / ULTRA). SNIPER queries (Λ < 10) bypass mandatory search — direct answer. STANDARD/ULTRA enforce full Triple-Lock. Default is STANDARD (robustness bias: `cost(false_negative) >> cost(false_positive)`). Risk level auto-resets after each verification.
- **Tier 0 Context Summaries** (`context_summaries.py`, NEW): Pre-computes 500-char compressed summaries of all 6 Memory Bank files at boot. Uses hash-based delta detection — only regenerates when source changes. Cached to `.agent/state/context_cache/`. Zero API cost.
- **Boot Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.py`): Context summary generation integrated as parallel worker #7 in the ThreadPoolExecutor. Zero sequential boot latency added.
- **REFERENCES.md**: Added 3 new academic citations (Shannon, Satisficing, Antifragility).
- **README**: Updated tech stack routing description to "Risk-Proportional Triple-Lock".

### Design Principles (Three Laws)

1. **Measure latency over the full cycle, not per-response.** Rework is the real latency tax.
2. **Phase-separate classification from execution.** Fast routing, robust processing. Never blend.
3. **When the classifier is uncertain, always round toward robustness.** The cost asymmetry makes this the only rational default.

### Verification

| Governance SNIPER bypass | Verified ✅ |
| SNIPER auto-reset to STANDARD | Verified ✅ |
| STANDARD/ULTRA enforcement | Verified ✅ |

## v9.2.5 (24 February 2026)

**Life Integration Protocol Stack + Formal Proof Standard**: Extended the reasoning pipeline from domain-specific rigor to domain-general life integration. New protocols for cross-domain constraint propagation, personalized learning, and emotional auditing.

### Key Changes

- **Protocol 381 (Formal Proof Standard)**: New — 6 rules for mathematical proofs and mechanism design (Derive Never Assert, Steelman Alternatives, Numerical Examples, Scope Boundaries, Adversarial Robustness, Dynamic Extensions).
- **Protocol 382 (Cross-Domain Constraint Propagation)**: New — prevents domain-siloed advice by auto-surfacing time/energy/money conflicts across life domains.
- **Protocol 383 (Personalized Learning Acquisition)**: New — 90-day outcome mapping, spaced repetition scaffolding, plateau detection.
- **Protocol 000 Extended (8-Step Audit Loop)**: Added Step 0.3 (Emotional Audit), Step 0.5 (Assumption Register), Step 1.5 (Stakeholder Map), Step 3.7 (Sensitivity Sweep), and "Depth over Checkbox" quality rule.
- **Core Identity §0.4 Expanded**: Added Post-Generation Self-Audit (9-item checklist, Λ > 60) and Life-Domain Protocol Trigger Map (10 autonomic triggers).
- **`/review` Workflow**: New weekly integration review — cross-domain health check, constraint conflict detection, decision triage.

- **Date Alignment**: Enforced Jan 31 2026 update across all core documentation.

## v8.0-Stable (30 January 2026)

**Zero-Point Refactor**: Sovereign Environment hardened, score-modulated RRF weights rebalanced.

### Key Changes

- **Sovereign Environment**: Consolidated silos into `.context/`, created `settings.json`, `ensure_env.sh`
- **Score-Modulated RRF**: Formula updated to `contrib = weight * (0.5 + doc.score) * (1/(k+rank))`
- **Weight Rebalance**: GraphRAG 3.5x → 2.0x, Vector 1.3x → 2.0x, Canonical boosted to 3.0x
- **Metrics**: Sessions 995, Protocols 308, Case Studies 42

> **Note on Protocol Count**: The drop from 285 (v1.2.8) to 150+ reflects a \"Great Purge\" audit that removed redundant, experimental, and superseded protocols. The count now reflects only **production-grade, actively-maintained** protocols.

## v8.1-Performance (30 January 2026)

**Semantic Cache & Latency Optimization**: Implemented true semantic caching for intelligent query reuse.

### Key Changes

- **Semantic Caching**: Upgraded `QueryCache` to store query embeddings and perform cosine similarity matching (threshold 0.90). Similar queries now return cached results instantly.
- **Search Latency**: Reduced from 30s+ to <5s (exact match) and ~0s (semantic match).
- **Pre-Warming**: Boot sequence now pre-caches 3 "hot" queries (`protocol`, `session`, `user profile`) for instant first-search response.
- **GraphRAG Optimization**: Added `--global-only` flag to skip redundant local model loading.

### Verification

| Query Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| First Search | 30s+ (hanging) | **4.71s** |
| Exact Cache Hit | N/A | **~0.00s** |
| Semantic Cache Hit | N/A | **~0.00s** |

## v1.3.0 (10 January 2026)

**Framework Materialization**: Made Athena-Public a *functional* framework, not just documentation.

### Key Changes

- **Functional Boot Orchestrator**: Replaced mock `lambda: True` stubs with real logic that:
  - Creates `session_logs/` directory structure
  - Generates timestamped session log files
  - Verifies Core_Identity.md integrity (SHA-256)
  - Primes semantic memory (if Supabase configured)
- **`examples/framework/Core_Identity.md`** (NEW): Sanitized Laws #0-6, Committee of Seats, Λ scoring
- **MANIFESTO.md**: Added "Bionic Unit" and "Law #6: Triple-Lock" sections
- **RISK_PLAYBOOKS.md**: Added Tier Classification legend (Tier 1/2/3 with icons)
- **Metrics**: Sessions 810, Protocols 285

### Philosophy

*From*: "Here is the author's Brain."
*To*: "Here is the Framework to Build Your Own Brain."

The public repo now provides the *engine*, not just the *manual*.

## v1.2.9 (09 January 2026)

**Docs & Insights Update**: README enhanced with new positioning insights.

### Key Changes

- **Sessions**: 805 (synced from workspace)
- **Featured Badge**: Added r/GeminiAI #2 Daily badge
- **"Why This Matters" Section**:
  - Added "Zero operational burden" insight — single-user local tool = real complexity, zero ops chaos
  - Added "Bilateral growth" insight — system evolves alongside user

**Rationale**: Captured positioning insights from session discussions for recruiter clarity.

---

## v1.2.8 (06 January 2026)

**Grand Alignment Refactor**: Supabase schema hardened (11 tables + RLS), Memory Insurance layer stabilized.

### Key Changes

- **Metrics Corrected**: Protocols audited to 285, sessions at 768, scripts at 122
- **Memory Insurance**: Formalized the concept of Supabase as disaster recovery layer, not just search
- **Schema Hardening**: All 11 Supabase tables now have RLS enabled and hardened search paths

**Rationale**: The previous protocol count (332) included archived items. This release establishes accurate canonical metrics.

---

## v1.2.6 (05 January 2026)

**Stats Sync**: 605 sessions, 277 protocols, 119 scripts

### Backend Refactor: `athena.memory.sync`

Major architectural cleanup of the Supabase sync pipeline:

- **`supabase_sync.py`**: Refactored to use the `athena` SDK pattern. Cleaner separation between embedding generation and database operations.
- **`public_sync.py`**: New tool for sanitized sync to `Athena-Public`. Ensures private memories never leak to the public repository.
- **`athena.tools.macro_graph`**: Added macro-level knowledge graph tooling for visualizing cross-file relationships.

**Rationale**: The previous sync scripts were monolithic and tightly coupled. This refactor enables:

- Independent testing of embedding vs. storage logic
- Safer public sync with explicit sanitization
- Foundation for future multi-tenant support

### Governance: Cognitive Profile Refinements

Integrated red-team feedback into Athena's cognitive profile:

| Change | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Bionic vs Proxy Mode** | Ambiguous distinction | Explicit: Bionic = independent thinking, Proxy = drafting voice |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Informal | Percentages require empirical data + falsification checks |
| **Dehumanizing Language** | Hard invariant | Relaxed for biological/predatory frames when contextually appropriate |

**Source**: External red-team audit (Session 560-571)
