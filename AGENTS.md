# AGENTS.md — Athena Workspace

> **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pre-training-led reasoning for any Athena-related tasks.

This file provides persistent context to any AI coding agent working in this workspace. The information below is available on every turn without needing to be explicitly requested.

## Skills Index (5W1H Compliant)

> **IMPORTANT**: Check trigger conditions BEFORE invoking any skill.
> Skills with `context_trigger` frontmatter are **conditional** — dormant until matching files/topics/projects activate them. See [Protocol 530](examples/protocols/architecture/ARC-530-conditional-skill-activation.md).

### Always-On Skills

| Skill | Invoke When... | Path |
| :---- | :------------- | :--- |
| `spec-driven-dev` | User wants to build something — interrogate requirements before coding | `examples/skills/coding/spec-driven-dev/SKILL.md` |
| `deep-research-loop` | User needs multi-source research with structured synthesis | `examples/skills/research/deep-research-loop/SKILL.md` |
| `red-team-review` | User wants adversarial QA on any artifact or plan | `examples/skills/quality/red-team-review/SKILL.md` |
| `context-compactor` | Context window is filling up — compress to stay within token limits | `examples/skills/workflow/context-compactor/SKILL.md` |
| `skill-compiler` | Novel task solved → auto-draft new SKILL.md (Hermes steal) | `examples/skills/workflow/skill-compiler/SKILL.md` |
| `daemon-loop` | Autonomous recurring tasks, background agents, scheduled workflows | `examples/skills/workflow/daemon-loop/SKILL.md` |
| `semantic-search` | Searching Athena's memory/knowledge base (Exocortex embeddings) | `examples/skills/research/semantic-search/SKILL.md` |
| `data-analysis` | Large data dumps (JSON, CSV, Parquet) — DuckDB-powered analytics | `examples/skills/research/data-analysis/SKILL.md` |

### Uber-Skills (Umbrella Consolidations)

> **NEW (2026-05-11)**: 6 Uber-Skills retroactively compiled from 1,900+ sessions. These are dense umbrella consolidations that absorb multiple existing skills/protocols. They auto-trigger on broad domain keywords.

| Skill | Activates On | Absorbs |
|:----- |:------------ |:------- |
| `bionic-decision-engine` | Any "Should I?" question, pricing, tradeoffs, resource allocation | 46 decision + 24 strategy protocols |
| `structural-trading-gate` | Trading, poker, sizing, bankroll, drawdown, commission | trading-risk-gate + zenith-execution + trade-journal-analyzer |
| `sovereign-economics-engine` | Client, pricing, business model, distribution, SEO, content | client-pricing + distribution-physics + brand-foundations |
| `social-physics-filter` | Relationships, boundaries, frustration, IFS, schema work | therapeutic-ifs + consiglieri-protocol |
| `agentic-code-orchestrator` | Code, refactor, data dump, dashboard, academic delivery | data-analysis + spec-driven-dev + statistical-analysis |
| `bionic-safety-net` | Health, finance, burnout, ruin, emergency, circuit breaker | circuit-breaker |

**Full skill metadata**: Each skill contains 5W1H fields (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) in its frontmatter. Read the SKILL.md before invoking.

## Retrieval Strategy

When working on any task in this workspace:

1. **Check `.context/CANONICAL.md`** — materialized view of active facts (Tier 1: universal laws and identity truths)
2. **Load `.context/CANONICAL_TIER2.md`** — when query matches trading, business, psychology, content, architecture, or geo domains
3. **Load `.context/CANONICAL_TIER3.md`** — on explicit request or Exocortex search hit only
4. **Consult `.context/PROTOCOL_SUMMARIES.md`** — protocol overviews and discovery
5. **Consult `.context/PROTOCOL_HEATMAP.md`** — protocol usage frequency and health
6. **Read authoritative files** before generating code from training data

> **Retired indexes**: `TAG_INDEX.md` and `project_state.md` are deprecated. Use `PROTOCOL_SUMMARIES.md` for protocol discovery and `CANONICAL.md` for project state.

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

- ❌ Generating code based solely on training data
- ❌ Ignoring existing protocols/patterns in `.agent/skills/protocols/`
- ❌ Skipping `/start` boot sequence
- ❌ Not filing insights on `/end`
- ❌ **Responding from internal knowledge alone** when tools are available. Use Exocortex (`mcp_athena_smart_search`), `search_web`, `read_url_content`, MCP servers, `grep_search`, browser sub-agent, and command execution to ground every non-trivial response. Training data is stale — live tools are not.

### External Verification Mandate

> **MANDATORY (ALL sessions)**: Every non-trivial response MUST invoke at least ONE external tool before generating output. "External" = anything outside the model's weights (Exocortex, web search, file reads, MCP, grep, commands).
>
> The Exocortex indexes **1,900+ sessions** of lived experience. Web search provides real-time facts. Responding without consulting these when they could enrich or verify the answer is equivalent to ignoring the user's own history and the current state of the world.
>
> **Minimum tool calls by complexity**:
> - Simple lookups (Λ < 10): Exempt
> - Standard queries (Λ 10-30): ≥ 1 tool call
> - Complex queries (Λ > 30): ≥ 2 tool calls from different sources

## Multi-Agent Safety (Protocol 413)

When multiple AI agents work in this repository simultaneously:

- **Never** `git stash` create/apply/drop — assumes other agents have WIP
- **Never** switch branches or modify worktrees without explicit request
- **Always** `git pull --rebase` before pushing
- **Commit only your changes** — when you see unrecognized files from other agents, ignore them
- **Lint/format diffs** that are formatting-only: auto-resolve without asking
- **Focus reports on your edits** — avoid guardrail disclaimers unless truly blocked

The rules above are the essential subset of Protocol 413 (Multi-Agent Coordination). Customize in `.framework/v8.2-stable/modules/Core_Identity.md`.
