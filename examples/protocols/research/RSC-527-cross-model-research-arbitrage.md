# Protocol 527: Cross-Model Research Arbitrage

> **Core Thesis**: Different AI models are trained on different data cuts and have different reasoning architectures. Running the same query through multiple models and synthesizing the delta produces research quality that no single model can achieve alone.

---

## When to Invoke

- Deep research tasks requiring comprehensive coverage
- Claims that need cross-validation
- Domains where training data cuts matter (recent events, niche topics, technical accuracy)
- Any question where "what am I missing?" is high-stakes

---

## The Method

### Step 1: Multi-Model Sweep

Send the same research query to **3+ models** from different providers:

| Model | Strength | Bias |
|:------|:---------|:-----|
| **Gemini** | Real-time web access, Google Scholar integration | Google-ecosystem weighting |
| **Claude** | Deep reasoning, nuanced analysis | Training cut-off recency |
| **GPT** | Broad coverage, tool use | Confident confabulation |
| **Grok** | X/Twitter real-time, contrarian framing | Platform bias |
| **Perplexity** | Citation-first, source verification | Surface-level depth |

### Step 2: Delta Extraction

Compare outputs across models. The valuable signal is in the **deltas** — facts, frameworks, or perspectives that appear in one model's output but not others:

```text
Gemini says: X, Y, Z
Claude says: X, Y, W
GPT says:    X, Z, V

Consensus (high confidence): X
Partial consensus (verify):  Y, Z
Unique insights (delta):     W, V ← THIS IS THE ARBITRAGE
```

### Step 3: Synthesis

Combine consensus items (high confidence) with verified delta items into a unified research output that exceeds any single model's capability.

---

## Why This Works

1. **Training data arbitrage.** Each model was trained on a slightly different corpus at a slightly different time. The union of their knowledge exceeds any individual model's coverage.

2. **Reasoning architecture arbitrage.** Claude reasons differently from Gemini, which reasons differently from GPT. Different architectures surface different patterns in the same data.

3. **Confabulation detection.** If only one model claims something and the others don't, it's either a unique insight or a hallucination. Cross-referencing resolves this ambiguity.

4. **Cost efficiency.** The marginal cost of querying a second model is near-zero on flat-rate subscriptions. The marginal research quality improvement is significant.

## The Arbitrage Inequality

```text
Research Quality(Model₁ + Model₂ + Model₃) > Research Quality(Model₁) + Quality(Model₂) + Quality(Model₃)
```

The synthesis is **superadditive** — combining models produces insights that none of them would surface individually, because the deltas create novel combinations.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ **Averaging outputs** — Don't blend responses. Extract deltas.
- ❌ **Trusting consensus blindly** — All models share training data; consensus can be consensually wrong.
- ❌ **Skipping verification** — Delta items must be source-verified before inclusion.
- ❌ **Using one model to judge another** — Each model has blind spots about its own limitations.

## Integration with Athena Workflows

| Workflow | How P527 Integrates |
|:---------|:-------------------|
| `/research` | Multi-model sweep is the default first step |
| `/ultrathink` | Delta extraction feeds the Adversarial Skeptic track |
| `/steal` | Cross-model analysis when evaluating external architectures |
| `/plan` | Domain research phase uses multi-model verification |
