# /resume — Session Recovery

> **Use Case**: Recover from browser crash, context switch, or unexpected interruption
> **Latency Profile**: LOW (~1K tokens)

---

## Behavior

When `/resume` is invoked:

1. **Detect Incomplete Session**
   - Scan `.context/memories/session_logs/` for most recent file
   - Check if `**Status**: ⏳ In Progress` (not `✅ Closed`)
   - If all sessions closed → "No interrupted session found. Use /start instead."

2. **Parse Recovery Context**
   - Extract last 5 checkpoints
   - Extract Focus and Action Items
   - Count total exchanges

3. **Display Recovery Summary**

```text
🔄 RESUMING SESSION: 2025-12-28-session-01.md

📋 Last 3 Checkpoints:
   [14:32] Implemented boot.py context handoff
   [14:45] Created /resume workflow
   [14:50] [last checkpoint summary]

📌 Pending Action Items:
   - Item 1
   - Item 2

⏰ Session Duration: ~2 hours | Exchanges: 12
```

1. **Continue Session**
   - Do NOT create new session file
   - Append to existing session
   - Run semantic prime on session content

## When to Use

- Browser crashed mid-session
- Stepped away and context was lost
- VS Code restarted
- "Where was I?"
