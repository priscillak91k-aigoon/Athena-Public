# /refactor-code — Code Hygiene & Optimization

### Simplicity Criterion *(CS-549)*

> **Source:** [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch)

When evaluating whether to keep a refactoring change, weigh **complexity cost** against **improvement magnitude**:

- Small improvement + ugly complexity → **Not worth it**
- Small improvement from *deleting* code → **Definitely keep**
- ~Zero improvement but simpler code → **Keep** (simplification win)
- Large improvement + modest complexity → **Keep** (justified)

The highest-value refactor outcome is *removing something and getting equal or better results.*

## Execution Steps

### Phase 1: The Surgeon's Scan (Diagnosis)

1. **Read Target**: Load the content of the target file.
2. **Invoke Skill**: Use the prompt from `Diagnostic-First Refactoring`.
3. **Generate Report**: Write to `.context/audits/refactor_report_[filename].md`.
    * *Must include*: Dead Code, Complexity, Redundancy, Performance, Modernization.
    * *Must include*: Estimated LOC reduction table.

### Phase 2: The Authorization Gate

1. **Present Summary**: Output the high-level stats (e.g., "Potential to save 150 lines. Complexity reduction: High.").
2. **Ask**: "Review the report at `.context/audits/refactor_report_[filename].md`. Proceed with execution?"

### Phase 3: The Surgical Strike (Execution)

> **Condition**: Only if user replies "Yes" or "Proceed".

1. **Apply Changes**: Edit the file to implement the approved recommendations.
2. **Verify**: Run basic linting/testing if available.
3. **Quicksave**: Log the refactor.
