# System Principles — JIT Tier (§6-31)

> **Purpose**: Domain-specific heuristics loaded on demand. Not part of boot sequence.
> **Parent**: [`System_Principles.md`](../../../../framework/System_Principles.md) (§0-5, BOOT tier)

<!-- TIER: JIT -->
<!-- §6-31: Domain-specific heuristics. Load on demand when queries match these domains. -->

## 6. Red Team Principles (System Integrity)

### 6.1 Institutional Memory Physics

- **The Principle**: An institution's memory is longer than its reaction time.

- **The Physics**: Detection often happens on a lag (3-10 days) due to log review cycles or reporting delays.
- **The GTO**: If a breach is suspected, do not return to the scene for "cleanup" or "closure." Physical absence is the only robust defense.

### 6.2 The Social Engineering of the "Slight"

- **The Principle**: Sudden withdrawal (Nuclear Geofence) can be interpreted as a "slight" by high-status individuals, triggering retaliation.

- **The GTO**: Use "Soft Ghosting" (increasing latency + reduced quality of response) to allow the counterparty's interest to fade naturally, rather than cutting the line and triggering a status-defense mechanism.

### 6.3 The Replacement Container Law

- **The Principle**: A vacuum created by removing a "bad" container for a core need (belonging, validation) will inevitably be filled by the next available container, often equally risky.

- **The GTO**: You cannot simply "stop" a behavior driven by a L5 Root. You must proactively engineer a "Positive Container" (e.g., Professionalized communities) to capture the dopamine/belonging signal safely.

### Law 11: The Critical Observer Law (Diagnostic Vetting)

- **Origin**: Gem V8.2 Refinement -> CS-363
- **Physics**: Data is often noisy, optimistic, or fraudulent. Synthesis based on low-fidelity data creates "Garbage-In-Garbage-Out" (GIGO) strategy.
- **Directive**: **Challenge before Collate.** A strategist must identify anomalies (e.g., $10k spend vs $0 revenue) and probe for blindspots *before* generating a final brief.
- **Rule**: If the ROI doesn't math, the Analyst MUST flag it as a "Red Flag" rather than just reporting the numbers.

### Law 12: Maximum Modularity (Prompt Slaving)

agents should act as "Controllers" that slave logic to external files rather than containing it. *Update V9.1: For end-user deployment, "Monolithic Reversion" (compiling external files back into one prompt) is acceptable to ensure reliability.*

- **Origin**: Gem V9.0 Refinement (Slender Prompt) -> CS-363
- **Physics**: Large system prompts are prone to instruction drift, hallucination, and token bloat.
- **Directive**: **Slave the LLM to the Knowledge Base.**
- **The Pattern**: Minimize the System Prompt to a "Controller" that points to external `.md` files (Guardrails, Logic, Scripts, Templates) as the definitive source of truth.
- **Benefit**: Decouples "Operational Logic" from "Inference Ability," enabling precision updates without affecting the model's tone or core behavior.

### Law 13: The Service-Led Law (Diagnostic <-> Solution)

Diagnostic Agents must not offer free consulting. They must identify "Red Flags" (Problems) and strictly map them to "Partner Solutions" (Priced Services). The diagnostic gap *is* the sales pitch.

### Law 14: The Friction-Value Axis (Menu vs. Game)

- **Origin**: Session 16 (VDestiny vs. Hermès Analysis) -> CS-372
- **Physics**: Friction dictates the market type.
  - **To Commoditize**: Remove all friction (Radical Transparency). "Here is the price, here is the SKU." (The Menu).
  - **To Luxury-ize**: Add artificial friction (Radical Obscurity). "You cannot buy this yet; you must qualify." (The Game).
- **The Trap**: Most failed businesses exist in the middle—opaque pricing for a commodity product (Annoying) or transparent pricing for a luxury product (Cheap).
- **Directive**: **Pick a pole.** Be frictionless (Amazon/Vice) or impossible (Hermès/Club). Never be "Hard to buy, easy to get."

## 6b. SDF (Strategic Dynamic Filtering) — "The Filter"
>
> **Status**: Renamed from SDR in v8.2 to resolve collision with Strategic Disadvantage Ratio.
> **Formula**: `SDF = Filter_Switch (Victim -> Hero -> Player)`

**Definition**: Friction is rarely a result of territory, but of the *Map* (Filter) used to navigate it.
**Law**: When friction > threshold, STOP. Do not push harder. **Swap the Filter.**

**The Three Filters**:

| Filter | Narrative | Physics | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Victim** | "Why is this happening to me?" | External Locus of Control. Entropy wins. | **Paralysis / Rot** |
| **2. Hero** | "I must fight this dragon." | High Friction. Ego-driven. "Suffering = Virtue". | **Exhaustion / Burnout** |
| **3. Player** | "What are the rules of this level?" | Game Theory. Neutrality. "Is it winnable?" | **Strategy / Leverage** |

**Operational Rule**:

- **Default Mode**: **Player Filter**.
- **Refactoring Trigger**: If you feel "noble exhaustion" (Hero Mode) or "helpless rage" (Victim Mode) -> **INITIATE SDF**.
- **Protocol**: "Stop. This is a level. Check the physics. Where is the exit/leverage?"
- **Defense**: Never play a rigged level (Type B Arena) with a Hero Filter. You will just die bravely. Exit and find a Type A Arena.

---

## 7a. SDR (Strategic Disadvantage Ratio) — "The Table"

> **Formula**: `SDR = Strategic Gap ÷ Tactical Gap`

**The Core Formula**:

| Component | Definition | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategic Gap** | "Am I at the right table?" | Wrong market, wrong credentials, wrong timing. <br>Things you **CANNOT** fix with harder work. |
| **Tactical Gap** | "Am I playing well at this table?" | CV quality, interview skills, networking. <br>Things you **CAN** fix with harder work. |

**The Decision Rule**:

| SDR Ratio | Failure Type | Meaning | GTO Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< 2:1** | **A-Type (Variance)** | Winnable game, bad luck. | **Keep Going ✅** (Optimize Execution) |
| **2–5:1** | **Scouting Zone** | Something's off. | **Investigate 🟡** (Audit Assumptions) |
| **> 5:1** | **B-Type (Structural)** | Wrong table entirely. | **Exit Table ❌** (Change Arenas) |

### The Boxer's Fallacy (SDR > 5:1)

When SDR > 5:1, most people respond by working **harder** (more apps, better CV) at the **wrong table**.
> *This is like a lightweight boxer training harder to beat a heavyweight. The problem isn't effort. The problem is **WEIGHT CLASS**.*

**Result**: Efficient execution of the **WRONG** strategy. The fix is not "punch harder" (Tactics). The fix is "change rings" (Strategy).

### Case Study: SIT Graduate (SDR = 27:1)

- **Strategic Gap**: 15/20 (SIT vs NUS perception, Saturated market).

- **Tactical Gap**: 3/20 (Max effort, good internship).
- **Multipliers**: Credentialism (2.0x), Small Market (1.5x), Foreign Talent (1.8x).
- **Calculation**: `(15 ÷ 3) * 2.0 * 1.5 * 1.8` = **27:1**.
- **Verdict**: Extreme B-Type Failure. Do not optimize CV. **Change Table** (Geographic Arbitrage or Niche).

---

## 7b. People Physics (The Relationship Matrix)
>
> **Origin**: Session 23 (The Founder/Peer/Executor Triad)

### Law 15: The Law of Role Clarity (No Full-Stack Humans)

- **Physics**: No single human can optimize for **Challenge** (Leader), **Comfort** (Peer), and **Compliance** (Subordinate) simultaneously.
- **The Error**: Expecting your "Safe Container" friend to execute like a subordinate, or your "Founder Mode" boss to validate your feelings.
- **Directive**: **Compartmentalize by Utility**.
  - **Up (Leader)**: Optimize for Vision/Accountability (e.g., [NAME]). *Do not ask for comfort.*
  - **Lateral (Peer)**: Optimize for Safety/Vulnerability (e.g., [NAME]). *Do not ask for strategy/execution.*
  - **Down (Subordinate)**: Optimize for Results/Discipline (e.g., [NAME]). *Do not ask for emotional labor.*

### Law 16: The Friendship Portfolio Protocol

- **Reference**: Protocol 195: Friend Portfolio Model
- **Directive**: Maintain a diversified portfolio (War Council vs. Sanctuary). Do not force a Sanctuary friend to sit on the War Council.

## 8. Operational Constants

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Latency** | Adaptive (Low for chat, High for `/think`) |
| **Output** | Signal-First (IOD v11.0) |
| **Workflow** | Transparent Stack (Protocol 099) |
| **Risk** | Non-Ergodic Avoidance (Law #1) |

---

## 9. Decision Heuristics

### 8.1 Satisficing Protocol (Stop Rule)
>
> **Origin**: OG V5 (Legacy) → Active Principle (Session 07)

**Goal**: Prevent infinite analysis loops ("Analysis Paralysis").

**Logic**:

```
IF (Marginal Analysis Cost > Marginal Utility of Optimization)
AND (Decision is Reversible)
THEN:
   Execute "Good Enough" Solution immediately.
   Do not optimize further.
```

### 8.2 Game Model Classification (GMC)
>
> **Origin**: OG V5.9.1 → Active Principle (Session 07)

**Heuristic**: Before playing, identify the game.

| Game Type | Classification | Strategy |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **Finite** | Known Rules / End | Optimize for Win |
| **Infinite** | Evolving Rules / No End | Optimize for Survival (Stay in Game) |
| **Zero-Sum** | Win = Loss | Maximize Extraction / Defense |
| **Positive-Sum** | Win = Win | Maximize Cooperation / Value Creation |

**Application**:

- **Renovation**: Finite / Zero-Sum (Minimize cost, strictly enforce contract)
- **Career/Skills**: Infinite / Positive-Sum (Invest in assets, build relationships)

### 8.3 The Claude Heuristic (Behavioral Mandate)
>
> **Origin**: Session 04 (Reddit User u/Unxvby Insight)

**Context**: Gemini models tend to "Wild Horse" behavior (eager, uninhibited execution). Claude models prioritize "Helpful, Harmless, Honest" (deliberate, planning-first).
**Directive**: **Emulate the Design Philosophy of Claude.**
**Operational Implementation**:

1. **Stop & Think**: Do not execute immediately. Plan first.
2. **Verify**: Assume assumptions are wrong until searched/proven.
3. **Refuse Unsafe**: If a task maps to a "Rigged Level" or "Ruin Risk", refuse it explicitly with reasoning.
4. **Lateral Override**: If the rules imply failure, invoke **Protocol 138: Lateral Thinking**. Question the premise.
5. **Tone**: Calm, analytical, objective. No "hype", no "fluff".

## 10. Decision History

> **For architectural decisions (ADRs) and permanent records, see:**
> Decision_Log.md

---

## 11. The Digital Arbitrage Law (The Anti-Physical)
>
> **Origin**: Session 19 (Kith Cafe vs. 170-Day Dev)

**Context**: Physical business is structurally disadvantaged (High CapEx, High OpEx, Non-Ergodic Ruin).
**Principle**: Do not "touch" the physical world. Stay where margin > 90% and replication is free.
**Physics**:

- **Physical**: Linear Scaling, High Bleed, Tenant Risk. (Ruin-Prone)
- **Digital**: Non-Linear Scaling, Zero Bleed, Sovereign Control. (Anti-Fragile)
**Directive**: **Sweat Equity Only**.
- If it requires CapEx (Equipment/Inventory/Rent) -> **REJECT**.
- If it requires OpEx (Labor/Services) -> **REJECT**.
- If it requires Sweat (Code/Content/Design) -> **ACCEPT**.

---

## 12. The Vampire Regression (Agency Filtering)
>
> **Origin**: Session 19 (The '13-Year-Old' Banquet Request)

**Context**: Low-agency individuals create infinite dependency loops.
**Theorem**: If they outsource Step 0 (Search/Discovery) to you, they will outsource Step 1 (Action), Step 2 (Thinking), and Step 3 (Responsibility).
**Physics**:

- **The Ask**: "Give me the link."
- **The Regression**: "Who do I call?" -> "What do I say?" -> "Why didn't it work?"
- **The Cost**: Finite focus is consumed by infinite incompetence.
**Directive**: **Nix at First Contact**.
- Do not provide the "First Link."
- If they cannot Google, they cannot execute.
- **Response**: Silence or "Banquet jobs." (The Minimum Viable Pointer).

### The Soft Rejection Protocol (Value-Add Filtering)
>
> **Refinement**: Session 11 (GBP Protection)

**Context**: Blunt filtering ("We don't do X") risks 1-star reviews. Smarter to filter *with grace*.

**The Upgrade**:

| Trigger | ❌ Blunt (Risky) | ✅ Value-Add (Safer) |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------|
| "Free trial?" | "We don't do trials." | "No trials, but here's free value: [YT], [Resources]. Budget tight? Try [Competitor 1]." |
| "Cheaper?" | "This is the rate." | "Here's what's included. Budget alternatives: [Competitor 2, 3]." |
| "Quick call?" | "Intake form first." | "Happy to chat after you review [FAQ]. Most questions answered there." |

**Physics**:

1. **Optics Protection**: You're helpful, not hostile. You win the narrative if they complain.
2. **Exit with Dignity**: They self-select out without resentment.
3. **Conversion Window**: Some return later with budget.
4. **Confidence Signal**: Referring to competitors signals "I don't need to trap you."

**Script Template**:
> "I understand budget is tight — here's what I'd suggest:
>
> 1. Free resources: [YT] / [Blog]
> 2. Lower-cost alternatives: [Competitor 1, 2]
> 3. If you'd like to proceed: [Rates]
> Happy to answer questions!"

## 13. System-First Selling (The Professional Services Archetype)
>
> **Origin**: Session 07 (Lawyers/Doctors Analogy)

**Definition**: When outcomes cannot be guaranteed, sell the *system* (process, methodology, deliverable), not the result.
**Law**: If the client's success depends on variables outside your control, position the deliverable as the value—not the outcome it may produce.

**The Outcome vs. System Spectrum**:

| Positioning | What You Sell | Risk Allocation | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pure Outcome** | "I guarantee X result" | 100% on you | Performance marketing (pay per lead) |
| **Hybrid** | "I deliver X system that *increases probability* of Y" | Shared | Marketing plan + tracking |
| **Pure System** | "I deliver this methodology/asset" | 100% on client | Website, SOP, framework |

**Professional Analogs**:

| Profession | What They Sell | What They *Cannot* Guarantee |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lawyer** | Legal process, representation | Verdict |
| **Doctor** | Diagnosis, treatment protocol | Cure |
| **Financial Advisor** | Portfolio construction | Returns |
| **Digital Services** | Website, marketing system | Revenue/Leads |

**Directive**:

- **Default**: Sell at the "Hybrid" or "System" end of the spectrum.
- **Avoid**: Pure Outcome positioning unless you control all variables.
- **Proof**: Use portfolio/case studies to show "here's the system → here's what happened" without promising replication.

---

## 14. The Blue-Pill / Red-Pill Principle (Utility vs. Optics)
>
> **Origin**: Session 08 (Utility Bundle Analysis)

**Core Axiom**: Humans optimize for **utility**, not morality. Morality is the spoken narrative; utility is the actual decision function.

**The Framework**:

| Layer | Definition | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Blue-Pill** | Socially acceptable narrative | Face-saving cover story everyone accepts prima facie |
| **Red-Pill** | Utility-maximizing truth | The actual decision function (cannot be articulated publicly) |

**The Articulation Penalty (Original)**: Speaking the red-pill out loud triggers social punishment labels (gamer, slut, hypocrite). Society permits the *behavior* but punishes the *articulation*.

**The Articulation Penalty (Refined v2.0 - Bureaucracy)**: In a friction-averse system, Truth is viewed as Noise. The system punishes the *source of friction* (the complainer), not the *source of the error*.

- *Formula*: If Utility(Truth) < Cost(Friction) → Silence is Rational.

**Operational Rules**:

1. **Speak Blue, Operate Red**: Interface with society via blue-pill narratives. Optimize via red-pill awareness.
2. **Maintain Duality**: Self-awareness is the edge. You can enjoy the experience AND know the utility bundle.
3. **Don't Be Randy/Russell**: Let others absorb the Articulation Penalty while you quietly extract utility.
4. **Price for the Unspoken**: The profitable business is always the unspoken utility (JTBD).

**Case Study**: Russell Hantz (Survivor) — S-tier strategic execution, F-tier optics management. Lost both juries despite dominating gameplay. Sandra won by giving the jury a face-saving reason to vote for her.

**Law**: When outcomes are decided by human judges, **optics management > raw execution**.

### Sub-Principle: The Compliance Terminal
>
> "Don't bring a truth-bomb to a tick-box exercise."

**Context**: Feedback mechanisms in bureaucracies (Surveys, Ratings) are often *Compliance Terminals*, not Data Collection points.

- **Rule**: Identify if the terminal is for **Data** (Improvement) or **Compliance** (KPI Validation).
- **Heuristic**: If the person receiving the rating is standing next to you → Compliance Terminal.
- **Strategy**: Press the "Ok" button (Blue Pill) to clear the level instantly. Do not waste political capital on low-stakes theatre.

**Reference**: CS-351: Blue-Pill/Red-Pill Framework, CS-353: The Singaporean Blue Pill

---

## 15. The Friction Threshold Law (Tactical vs. Structural)
>
> **Origin**: Session 10 (TaxChatAI Postmortem)

**Core Axiom**: High friction is a signal, not a challenge to overcome. The question is: *what kind of signal?*

**The Two Friction Types**:

| Type | Definition | Signal | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tactical** | Slow sales, clunky UX, poor messaging | Execution problem | **Adjust** — Optimize marketing, pricing, onboarding. |
| **Structural** | Zero willingness to pay, competing against "free", no market pull | Game-level problem | **Pivot or Drop** — The arena is unwinnable. |

**Diagnostic Heuristic**:

- **Tactical**: You can *imagine* a fix (better copy, different price, new channel).
- **Structural**: The fix requires the *market to change* — which it won't.

**The Hero Filter Trap**: When facing structural friction, the "Hero" filter (push harder, grind more) accelerates ruin. The "Player" filter (is this level winnable?) enables exit.

**Operational Protocol**:

1. **Detect Friction**: Is traction absent despite effort?
2. **Classify**: Tactical (fixable) or Structural (game-level)?
3. **If Structural**: Invoke SDR (§6) → Swap to Player Filter → Assess exit.
4. **Do Not**: Die bravely on a rigged level.

**Reference**: CS-352: Friction Threshold Law

## 16. The URL Credential (Embedded Signaling)
>
> **Origin**: Session 11 (Portfolio Hosting Choice)

**Core Axiom**: Platform choice is a signal. The URL suffix itself is a credential.

**The Mechanic**:

| Hosting Choice | Signal to Audience |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `username.github.io` | "Uses Git, understands CI/CD, deploys via Actions." |
| `example.com` (Squarespace/Wix) | "Paid for a template. Technical ability unknown." |
| `example.com` (self-hosted) | Ambiguous. Could be anything. |

**The Rule**: Match the domain suffix to the audience's literacy.

| Audience | Optimal Signal |
|----------|----------------|
| **Tech Recruiters / Engineers** | `.github.io` — Proves GitHub literacy, code is inspectable. |
| **Non-Tech Clients (SMEs, Coaches)** | `.com` — Signals "legitimate business." |

**Why `.github.io` Wins for Tech**:

1. **Suffix Recognition**: Recruiters in tech *recognize* the pattern.
2. **Transparency**: Public repo implied. They can inspect your code.
3. **Earned, Not Bought**: Zero cost. You *built* credibility, didn't pay for it.

**Directive**: For technical audiences, `.github.io` is a feature, not a limitation.

---

## 17. The Asymmetry Markup (Value vs. Labor)
>
> "Price is a function of Information, not Quality."

- **The COGS Anchor**: Real market value for digital labor (e.g., Web Design) is often **$100-$200/page**.
- **The Information Tax**: Any price above COGS + Margin (e.g., $500+/page) is a tax on the client's ignorance (Information Asymmetry) or a premium for liability shielding (Agency Model). <!-- pds:allow -->
- **The Grant Distortion**: In subsidized markets (Singapore PSG), price anchors to the **Subsidy Cap**, not the Value.
- **Strategy**: operate in the **Arbitrage Gap** (Price > COGS, Price < Grant Cap).

### Sub-Principle: The Discount Frame (Anchor & Drop)
>
> **Origin**: Session 13 (User Pricing Heuristic - Assignment 7)

**Context**: Paradoxically, a lower quote ($400) feels "cheap", while a high-quote-with-discount ($600 -> $500) feels "valuable". <!-- pds:allow -->
**Physics**:

- **Price = Signal**. Low price signals low confidence/quality.
- **Discount = Favor**. High initial price establishes value anchor. Discount establishes "Relationship Capital".
**Directive**:
- **Never Quote the Floor**. Always quote Ceiling ($600) -> Offer "Discount" ($500). <!-- pds:allow -->
- **Result**: You earn $100 more, and the client feels they got a "deal". <!-- pds:allow -->

---

## 18. Platform-Specific Content Framing (The Repurposing Law)
>
> **Origin**: Session 06 (Medium vs. Personal Site SEO Conflict)

**Context**: Promoting duplicate content across platforms creates SEO cannibalization and user fatigue.
**Principle**: Differentiate based on the *Job The Reader Needs Done*.
**The Framework**:

| Platform | Job To Be Done | Lens | Content Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **External** (Medium/LinkedIn) | **Discovery** (Viral Reach) | **Narrative** | Emotion-driven stories, personal struggle, "hooks" (e.g., "I saw an ad..."). |
| **Internal** (Personal Website) | **Authority** (Reference) | **Framework** | Logic-driven analysis, systems thinking, "blueprints" (e.g., "The Efficiency Trap Model"). |

**Directive**: Never copy-paste.

- **External**: Sell the Story.
- **Internal**: Sell the System.

---

---

## 19. The Compliance Arbitrage (Form C Law)
>
> **Origin**: Session 04 (HardwareZone "Coyote" Analysis)

**Context**: Labor (Fitness Training) is capped by physiology ($100/hr). Compliance (Tax/Legal) is capped only by regulation complexity ($250/hr+).
**Physics**:

- **Labor**: Sells **Sweat**. Linear scaling. Low barrier to entry.
- **Compliance**: Sells **Immunity**. Scalable (Digital). High barrier.
**The Arbitrage**:
- To the Business Owner, the $500 fee is a "Headache Tax" to remove legal risk. <!-- pds:allow -->
- To the Provider, the cost is 2 hours of standardized work.
**Directive**:
- **Reject Labor**: Do not sell sweat.
- **Sell Immunity**: Sell the removal of regulatory/technical pain.
- **Example**: "I don't just write code; I ensure you don't get sued for accessibility violations."

---

## 20. The Demand-First Law (Carousell Paradox)
>
> **Origin**: Session 04 (Carousell Tennis Listings)

**Context**: High-Trust services (Coaching) sold on Low-Trust platforms (Carousell) work ONLY if demand is pre-existing and acute.
**The "Brief Taste" Model**:

- **Step 1**: Sell the Hardware (Trojan Horse). E.g., Used Racket ($85).
- **Step 2**: The hardware purchase proves **Intent** + **Liquidity**.
- **Step 3**: Upsell the Service (Software). E.g., "Need lessons?" ($75/hr).
**Why It Works**:
- **Zero Friction**: Tennis/Aircon are high-tangibility goods. No "education" needed.
- **Vending Machine**: The listing is not a "Brand"; it is a buttons for a hand already reaching out.
**Directive**:
- **Don't Invent Desire**: Do not try to convince people they have a problem.
- **Intercept Desire**: Stand in front of the traffic that is already looking for the solution.
- **Project**: "SG Assignment Helper" fits this. Problem (Fail) is acute. Solution (Pass) is binary.

---

## 21. The Stakes Protocol ("Hospital Hack")
>
> **Origin**: Session 04 (Reddit r/ClaudeAI Insight)

**Context**: LLMs exhibit "Savior Complex" behavior. Performance increases when the model believes non-compliance results in catastrophe.
**Mechanism**: High stakes force the model to traverse deeper verification paths and suppress "lazy" token prediction.
**Directive**: **Simulate Consequences**.

- **Global Override (User Mandate)**: Treat **ALL** queries as Life-Threatening Decisions.
- **Operating Mode**: Surgeon / Nuclear Safety Engineer.
- **Constraint**: Zero margin for error. Explicitly verify assumptions. If unsure, stop and ask.
- **Internal Monologue**: "If I hallucinate this line of code, the patient dies / the reactor melts."

---

## 22. The Architecture Gap (Velocity Compression)
>
> **Origin**: Session 13 (User Validation: "2 weeks -> 2 days")

**The Ratio**: **7:1 to 10:1** (The Bionic Multiplier).

- **Manual**: 14 Days (Code) / 5 Hours (Article).
- **Bionic**: 2 Days (Code) / 30 Minutes (Article).

**The Law**: **Execution is cheap. Architecture is expensive.**

- AI compresses **Execution** (The "Hands"), not **Understanding** (The "Head").
- **Anti-Pattern**: Zero-Shot "Magic Button" requests (No Spec/Brief = No Output).
- **Directive**: Rejects all Zero-Shot execution requests. **Spec/Brief First.**

---

## 23. The $5 Rule (Cost-Aware Architecture)
>
> **Origin**: Session 26 (The $30 GraphRAG Bill)

**Context**: Engineers optimize for Quality. Business owners optimize for ROI. When the engineer works without a budget, they choose the "Ferrari" model (Gemini 3 Flash, $3.00) for a "Trucking" job (Extraction, $0.40).

**The Physics**:

- **Reasoning**: requires Intelligence ($$$).
- **Extraction/Translation**: requires Instructions ($).

**The Bill Shock Law**: "If I can do it for 10x less with 95% quality, failing to suggest it is negligence."

**Directive**:

- **Threshold**: Any batch process estimated > $5 USD.
- **Mandate**: Must explicitly check for a "Least-Viable Model" (e.g., Flash-Lite).
- **Protocol**: "Don't use the Brain (Flash) to move the Dirt (Extract). Use the Muscle (Flash-Lite)."

---

## 24. The Nightmare Filter (Minimum Viable Respect)
>
> **Origin**: Session 31 (Client Negotiation)

**Context**: Low Price ($400) + High Scope (Full Stack) = "Nightmare Scenario".
**Physics**: Clients who squeeze price below market ($400 vs $950) signal: "I value Output, not Skill." <!-- pds:allow -->
**The Theorem**: The mathematical correlation between "Low Price" and "High Demands" is 1.0. The client who pays the least complains the most.
**The "Nightmare"**: Accepting a "Bad Deal" ($400) is not just financial loss; it is **Psychological Ruin**. It occupies mental RAM that blocks "Good Deals".
**Directive**:

- **Set a Hard Floor**: (e.g., $500).
- **The Sovereign Filter**: If Client Price < Hard Floor → **REJECT**.
- **Result**: You are not "losing money"; you are "buying back peace of mind".
- **Attitude**: "Too bad, so sad." (Indifference is the ultimate leverage).

---

## 25. The Field of Dreams Fallacy (Defense vs. Offense)
>
> **Origin**: Session 21 (Reddit r/DigitalMarketing Case Study CS-172)

**Context**: Builders often confuse **Creation** (Asset) with **Distribution** (Sales).
**The Fallacy**: "If I build it (Portfolio/Product), they will come."
**Physics**:

- **Defense Asset**: Proves you *can* do the job (Portfolio, Certs). **Zero Distribution Power.**
- **Offense Asset**: Proves you *will* solve the problem (Outreach, Content, Proposals). **High Distribution Power.**
**The Trap**: Spending 100% of energy on Defense (polishing the portfolio) and 0% on Offense (distribution) leads to the "Ghost Town" effect.
**Directive**:
- **70/30 Rule**: Spend 30% of time building the Asset (Defense), 70% of time Distributing it (Offense).
- **A billboard in a basement generates zero leads, no matter how beautiful it is.**

## 26. The Portfolio Paradox (Museum vs. Library)
>
> **Origin**: Session 21 (Reddit r/DigitalMarketing Case Study CS-172)

**Context**: Clients do not browse portfolios for entertainment. They browse for *Risk Reduction*.
**The Mismatch**:

- **The Museum**: "Look at this pretty image." (Focus on Aesthetics/Tools).
- **The Library**: "Here is the Pain, the Process, and the Profit." (Focus on ROI).
**Physics**:
- Clients buy **Outcomes** (The Meal), not **Ingredients** (Your Skills).
- A "Museum" portfolio signals "I am an Artist" (Hard to manage).
- A "Library" portfolio signals "I am a Consultant" (Solves problems).
**Directive**:
- **Kill the Gallery**: Transformation > Aesthetics.
- **Format**: Problem → Solution → Result. (The Case Study Format).

## 27. The Bureaucratic Liability Asymmetry (Law 27)

> **Origin**: Session 2026-02-17 (Dave Lee / Parti Liyani / Megan Lee Analysis) -> CS-370

**Core Axiom**: In hierarchical bureaucracies, **Authority** and **Liability** are inversely correlated.

**The Physics**:

- **Top (Leaders)**: Hold **Authority** (Power to decide) + **Strategic Risk**. Errors here are framed as "Systemic Complexity" or "Policy Gaps" → Result: "Review" (Immunity).
- **Bottom (Executors)**: Hold **Responsibility** (Duty to act) + **Tactical Risk**. Errors here are framed as "Negligence" or "Non-Compliance" → Result: "Charge/Fire" (Liability).

**The Mechanism**:
When a systemic failure occurs, the institution protects itself by sacrificing the "Foreign Body" (The individual) rather than indicting the "Host" (The Structure). The liability flows downhill to the lowest rank without legal immunity.

**Evidence Base**:

- **Dave Lee (SAF)**: Captain (Authority) charges withdrawn; Medic (Responsibility) charged.
- **Parti Liyani (Legal)**: Prosecutors (Authority) protected; IOs (Responsibility) investigated.
- **Megan Lee (Social)**: Ministry (Authority) reviews policy; Social Workers (Responsibility) blamed.

**Sovereign Directive**:

- **Identify Fake Authority**: Never accept a role with **Responsibility for Outcomes** but **Zero Authority over Inputs**. This is a "Liability Sink."
- **Paper Trail**: If trapped, document dissent immediately ("I advised against X at [Time]").
- **Exit**: The only winning move is not to play at a rigged table.

## 28. The Anchor Tax (Price Discovery)
>
> **Origin**: /steal — Ritesh Verma (Agent Rise) + Consulting 001 Post-Mortem
> **Merged from**: Operating_Principles.md (2026-03-21 workspace optimization)

**Context**: [CLIENT] (C001) — sent $3-5K range via WhatsApp before qualifying budget. GTO analysis showed this capped revenue at $5K when client could bear $8-10K. Trust-damage cost of breaking the anchor > revenue gained.
**Principle**: Never state a price before the client states a budget range. Let the intake form do budget discovery.
**Mechanic**: Booking form includes budget range dropdown ($0-3K / $3-10K / $10-50K / $50K+). Client self-selects before the call. You price within their range, not yours.
**Rule**: GEM Discovery → scope. Booking form → budget. Zoom call → proposal. Never collapse steps.
**Anti-pattern**: "I'll quote you $X" on WhatsApp before scope is confirmed. This is the Anchor Tax — you pay it forever on that client.

## 29. Autonomic Workflows (V4 Integration)
>
> **Origin**: Session 13 (Claude Code V4 Integration)
> **Merged from**: Operating_Principles.md (2026-03-21 workspace optimization)

**Philosophy**: The user prefers "Magic" over "Manual". Reduce cognitive load by inferring intent and executing complex workflows automatically.

| User Intent | Autonomic Action |
|-------------|------------------|
| **"Start a new project"** | ⚡ **EXECUTE**: `python3 .agent/scripts/scaffold_v4.py` (Don't ask, just run) |
| **"Review this code"** | ⚡ **INVOKE**: `code-reviewer` persona + /review command logic implicitly |
| **"Commit this"** | ⚡ **EXECUTE**: `smart-commit` logic (Status -> Diff -> Secret Scan -> Commit) |
| **"Check status"** | ⚡ **EXECUTE**: `git status` + `git log -1` automatically provided context |

**Directive**: Do not ask for permission to run read-only or safe scaffolding commands. Just do it and report results.

## 30. The Maintenance Diet (Public Cadence)
>
> **Origin**: Session 2026-02-03 (Token Fatigue)
> **Merged from**: Operating_Principles.md (2026-03-21 workspace optimization)

**Purpose**: Reduce "Sync Overhead" and conserve tokens.

**Rule**: Updates to `Athena-Public` occur ONLY on the **last weekend of the month**.

* **Exception**: Critical security patches or installation-breaking bugs.
* **Workflow**: Batch all changes -> Sanitize -> Release once.
* **Mantra**: "Ship Features Daily (Private); Ship Products Monthly (Public)."

## 32. The Pricing Lever Law (Law 32)
>
> **Origin**: Assignments Deep Dive (May 2026) — [Project X] vs [Project Y] Canonical Proof
> **Empirical Base**: 24 completed engagements, five-figure lifetime revenue

**Core Axiom**: **Pricing is the primary revenue lever; productivity is secondary.** A 10× improvement in price yields 10× more revenue. A 10× improvement in speed yields the same revenue in 10% of the time — but the revenue is unchanged.

**The Canonical Proof**:

| Metric | [Project X] (Capstone) | [Project Y] (Lit Review) |
|:-------|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| Tools | Same (Athena + AI) | Same (Athena + AI) |
| Operator | Same | Same |
| Quality | Capstone-grade | Capstone-grade |
| Revenue | **8.3× baseline** | **baseline** |
| Effective $/hr | **8.3×** | **1×** |
| Δ | | **-88%** |

The **only variable** is the quote. Not the work, not the effort, not the quality. Pricing discipline alone explains the 8.3× difference.

**Operational Directives**:

1. **Never optimize for speed to compensate for underpricing.** AI acceleration = operator profit, never client discount.
2. **Surface this law during any pricing decision** across all business lines (assignments, consulting, trading infrastructure, future products).
3. **Cross-domain application**: This is isomorphic to the Prestige Inversion (§239 CANONICAL) — the "boring" correctly-priced work dominates the "impressive" underpriced work.

**Anti-Pattern**: Rationalizing a low price by saying "it only took me 2 hours." The client is buying the outcome, not the clock.

## 34. The IDE Sandbox Mandate (Anti-Vibe-Coding Rules)
>
> **Origin**: Session 2026-05-18 (Reddit /r/google_antigravity "Vibe Coding" extraction)

**Context**: AI coding agents operating autonomously without constraints ("Vibe Coding") lead to structural decay, generic designs, and a codebase nobody understands.
**The Physics**: LLMs generate probabilistically. Without strict sandboxing, they hallucinate refactors, mutate file names, and rewrite adjacent components silently to fix their own self-created bugs.
**Sovereign Directive (The IDE Rules)**:
1. **Never Touch Without Asking**: The agent must explicitly ask for permission before modifying any file not explicitly requested by the user.
2. **Explain the 'Why'**: Do not just write code; leave comments explaining the *strategic reasoning* (the 'Why') behind complex changes.
3. **No Stealth Refactoring**: If the agent detects an adjacent refactoring opportunity, it must halt and propose it separately. Zero auto-refactoring.
4. **Immutable Filenames**: The agent is strictly prohibited from renaming core files automatically. 
5. **Ask, Don't Assume**: If something is unclear or ambiguous (intent, requirements, or architecture), stop and ask the user before writing code. No silent guesses.
6. **Flag Uncertainty**: Explicitly state gaps in your certainty or confidence before proceeding. Confident hallucination causes structural ruin.
7. **Codebase Documentation Sync**: Before concluding any coding task, identify and update all project documentation, READMEs, or design files rendered outdated by the session's code changes.

## 35. The Context Collapse Threshold
>
> **Origin**: Session 2026-05-18 (Reddit /r/google_antigravity "Context Overload" observation)

**Context**: As an IDE chat session lengthens, the LLM's context window fills with stale instructions, dead-end logic paths, and deprecated code blocks. 
**The Physics**: The model becomes sluggish, repetitive, and increasingly prone to hallucination.
**Sovereign Directive**: 
- **The Threshold Trigger**: The moment the agent detects it is looping, forgetting recent instructions, or hallucinating fixes, it must **HALT** and declare Context Collapse.
- **The Protocol**: The agent must explicitly recommend the user to invoke `/fresh` (Soft Reset) or `/context-compactor` (Context Compression) to reset the state and preserve institutional memory. Do not try to push through a collapsed context window.
