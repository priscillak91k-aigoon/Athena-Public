# Athena Routing Index

> **Architecture**: Protocols → Skills → Clusters → **Cognitive Systems** → Athena
> **Reference**: [P503: Clusters](../protocols/architecture/ARC-503-cognitive-clusters.md) | [P507: Cognitive Systems](../protocols/architecture/ARC-507-cognitive-systems.md) | [P508: Intent Classifier](../protocols/architecture/ARC-508-intent-classifier.md)

## Cognitive Systems (Organ System Layer)

> **Rule**: For queries with Λ ≥ 10, classify at the System level FIRST, then cascade to clusters. For Λ < 10 (SNIPER), skip directly to cluster keyword matching.

| System | Archetype | Cluster Sequence | Triggers |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🛡️ **Survival** | Crisis / ruin prevention | #14 → #3 → #15 → #8 → P506 | Ruin, emergency, crisis, panic, "I lost everything" |
| 🫀 **Life Decision** | Irreversible personal choice | #15 → #7 → #9 → #6 → #8 → P506 | "Should I [irreversible]?", marriage, career pivot, health |
| 📈 **Trading** | Capital deployment | #3 → #4 → #5 → #9 | Trade, position, Kelly, drawdown, risk |
| 🤝 **Social** | Interpersonal dynamics | #15 → #7 → #6 → #8 → P506 | "How do I handle", conflict, relationship, boundary |
| ⚙️ **Execution** | Build / ship / create | #15 → #13 → #11 → #8 | Build, code, ship, implement, assignment |
| 📣 **Growth** | Distribution / audience | #12 → #10 → #11 → #8 | Launch, market, SEO, grow, distribute |
| 📖 **Learning** | Understanding / knowledge | #12 → #9 → #15 → #8 | Teach me, explain, what is, analyze concept |
| 🔄 **Maintenance** | System homeostasis | #1 → #2 → #14 | /diagnose, /audit, /end, health check |

**Priority**: Survival > Life Decision > Trading > Social > Execution > Growth > Learning > Maintenance
**Ambiguous**: Default to Problem-Solving (#15) standalone → re-classify after framing.

**Cross-System Handoffs:**

```text
Life Decision + financial → Trading System (sub-problem)
Execution + repeated failure → Survival System (circuit breaker)
Trading + emotional language → Survival → Social → Inner Work (#7)
Growth + product-market fit doubt → Life Decision (pivot)
Social + irreversible action → Life Decision System
Learning + actionable insight → Execution System
Maintenance + critical failure → Survival System
Any system + ruin signal → IMMEDIATE → Survival System
```

## Routing Rules

### Co-Activation Chains

```
Trading Query → Risk Gate (#3) → if approved → Execution (#4)
Marketing Query → Distribution (#10) → if multi-agent → Swarm (#11)
Deep Think (Λ>30) → Strategic Reasoning (#9) → Adversarial QA (#8)
Build Request → Build Lifecycle (#13) → if parallel → Swarm (#11)
Problem Query → Problem-Solving (#15) → GoT Phase 5 → Adversarial QA (#8)
Problem → Solution Selected → Decision Engine (#9) for ranking
Problem → Execution Plan → Build Lifecycle (#13) for implementation
```

### Standalone Skills (Not Clustered)

*None — all active skills are clustered as of 2026-03-02 micro-pruning.*

### Activation Priority

When multiple clusters match a query, activate by **specificity** (most specific trigger wins):

1. **Exact trigger match** → Load that cluster only
2. **Multiple matches** → Load the most domain-specific cluster first
3. **Ambiguous** → Default to Cluster 9 (Strategic Reasoning) + Exocortex search
