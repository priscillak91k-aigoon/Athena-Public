# Structural Trading Gate — The Zero-Emotion Variance Shield

> **Compiled**: 2026-05-11 (retroactive synthesis of all trading sessions)
> **Problem Class**: Any capital allocation question — FX, crypto, CFDs, poker, casino. Pre-trade safety, position sizing, post-trade analytics.
> **Axiom**: *"In non-ergodic systems, the strategy that maximizes EV is the one most likely to kill you. Survival > Optimization."*

## When to Use

Invoke whenever the user mentions:
- Any trade setup, entry, or sizing question
- Bankroll management (poker or trading)
- Drawdown analysis or recovery
- Commission/friction cost optimization
- Post-trade review or journal analysis
- "Should I hold over the weekend?"

## Solution Architecture

### Pre-Trade: The Three-Gate Pipeline

```
GATE 1: Law of Ruin          GATE 2: Ergodicity           GATE 3: WR Dominance
┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐
│ P(Ruin) > 5%?       │ ──▶ │ Non-ergodic?         │ ──▶ │ WR < Breakeven?     │
│ 5 Domains:          │     │ Absorbing barrier?   │     │ Variance Drag > EV? │
│ Bio/Legal/Fin/      │     │ P(survive N) < 80%?  │     │ RR structure viable? │
│ Social/Psych        │     │                      │     │                      │
│ VETO if YES ❌      │     │ VETO if YES ❌       │     │ WARN if YES ⚠️      │
└─────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘     └─────────────────────┘
```

### Position Sizing: Half-Kelly (DEC-046)

```
Full Kelly:  f* = (bp − q) / b
Half-Kelly:  f  = f* / 2

Where:
  b = net odds (reward ÷ risk)
  p = probability of winning
  q = 1 − p

Example (10% EV, 1:3 R:R):
  b = 3, p = 0.55, q = 0.45
  f* = (3 × 0.55 − 0.45) / 3 = 0.40 (40% — suicidal)
  f  = 0.40 / 2 = 0.20 (20% — still aggressive)
  Practical: Cap at 1-2% risk per trade for operational safety.
```

**Rule**: Half-Kelly is the MAXIMUM. Industry standard 1-2% risk per trade is the operational floor.

### The Variance Shields

| Arena | Variance Shield | Rationale |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| FX / CFD Trading | 2% max risk per trade | Ensures >95% survival over 100-trade sequences |
| Poker (Spins) | 300 buy-ins minimum | Neutralizes high-variance format |
| Poker (Cash) | 40 buy-ins minimum | Lower variance, faster recovery |
| Casino (Arbitrage) | 309-unit bankroll | Points farming protocol |

### The Iron Laws

| Law | Rule | Source |
|-----|------|--------|
| **No Weekend Holding** | Close ALL positions before market close Friday | CS-d11d5a7c: Weekend gaps = unhedgeable ruin |
| **No Martingale** | Never double down after a loss | CS-459: Martingale = guaranteed ruin at N→∞ |
| **Commission Awareness** | Calculate REAL EV after all friction | CS-9a7c4607: 46% commission drag on FX → pivot to 0-commission oil |
| **Drop-Down Trigger** | If bankroll hits X% drawdown, mechanically drop stakes | CS-76208648: Eliminate psychological tilt |
| **No FOMO Re-entry** | If stopped out, wait for fresh setup | TRD-369: "Fuck-Unfuck" principle |

### Layering Strategy (Advanced)

For mean-reversion and grid-based entries:

```
Layer 1: 30% of intended position at first signal
Layer 2: 30% at confirmation (e.g., structure break)
Layer 3: 40% at optimal entry (e.g., liquidity sweep)

Total risk across all layers: Still ≤ 2% of capital
```

### The Efficiency-Survival Inversion (MP-2)

| "Efficient" (Looks Smart, Kills You) | "Robust" (Looks Dumb, Survives) |
|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| Full Kelly sizing | Half-Kelly |
| 58% allocation, max profit | 6% allocation, survives tail |
| Narrow SL + High R:R | Wide SL + High WR |
| Hold for "the big move" | Partial profit + re-entry |

**Rule**: Growth = Edge − (Variance² / 2). Variance is a SUBTRACTION term. High WR structurally dominates High RR (TRD-367).

### Post-Trade: Journal Analysis

After every trade or session:

1. **Classify the outcome**: Win/Loss/Breakeven
2. **Classify the process**: Good Process / Bad Process
3. **Map to drawdown type**:
   - Type A: Bad luck (good process, bad outcome) → Continue
   - Type B: Bad execution (bad process) → Fix the leak
   - Type C: System drift (rules changed) → Recalibrate
4. **Log friction costs**: Spread + commission + swap = REAL cost per trade

## Failure Modes & Mitigations

| Failure | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **FOMO Override** | Gate 1 is NON-NEGOTIABLE. No "just this once." |
| **Revenge Trading** | Drop-Down Trigger is MECHANICAL, not discretionary |
| **Weekend Gap Risk** | Hard rule: Close ALL by Friday COB. No exceptions. |
| **Commission Blindness** | Calculate friction FIRST, then decide if edge survives |
| **Hindsight Bias** | Carnot Engine Fallacy (§325): The "perfect trade" only exists in hindsight |

## Validated Patterns (Empirical)

- [V] **High WR > High RR**: Variance Drag (V²/2) geometrically destroys low-WR portfolios. A 70% WR / 1:1 RR system dominates a 30% WR / 1:3 RR system over N>100 trades. | Reapply: Every system design.
- [V] **Commission Drag Kills Edge**: 46% commission drag on FX vs 0% on oil CFDs. Switching arenas is a higher-EV move than optimizing entries. | Reapply: Every new instrument evaluation.
- [V] **Half-Kelly is Maximum**: Full Kelly = theoretical ceiling (Carnot Engine). Half-Kelly = operational reality. | Reapply: Every position sizing calculation.
- [V] **Weekend Gaps are Non-Ergodic**: A single weekend gap can wipe weeks of gains. The expected cost of holding > expected gain. | Reapply: Every Friday.
